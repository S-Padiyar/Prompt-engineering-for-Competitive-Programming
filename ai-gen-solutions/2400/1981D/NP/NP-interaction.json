We build the (undirected) “complete +\\\\!loops” graph on those \\\\(k\\\\) vertices, find an Eulerian cycle, and output the first \\\\(n\\\\) vertices of that cycle.  Since every unordered pair (including loops) appears at most once, the products \\\\(a_i\\\\cdot a_{i+1}\\\\) are all distinct.\\n\\n- One small detail is building the adjacency‐structure and running Hierholzer’s algorithm in \\\\(O(k^2)\\\\).

A set of \\\\(k\\\\) vertices (with loops) has exactly \\\\(\\\\tfrac{k(k+1)}2\\\\) unordered‐pairs (including loops).  Solving\\n   \\\\[\\n     \\\\tfrac{k(k+1)}2 \\\\;\\\\ge\\\\; n-1\\n   \\\\]\\n   gives \\\\(k = \\\\bigl\\\\lceil(\\\\sqrt{1+8(n-1)} - 1)/2\\\\bigr\\\\rceil\\\\).  We then bump \\\\(k\\\\) to the next odd integer if needed, so that the “complete + loops” graph on \\\\(k\\\\) vertices is Eulerian.\\n\\n2. **The Graph and an Eulerian Cycle.**  \\n   - Vertices are indexed \\\\(0,1,\\\\dots,k-1\\\\).  \\n   - We add one undirected edge \\\\(\\\\{u,v\\\\}\\\\) for each \\\\(0 \\\\le u < v < k\\\\), and one loop \\\\(\\\\{u,u\\\\}\\\\) at each \\\\(u\\\\).  \\n   - An Eulerian cycle visits each edge exactly once (possible because all degrees are even when \\\\(k\\\\) is odd).  \\n   - Such a cycle has length \\\\(E+1\\\\), where \\\\(E=k(k+1)/2\\\\).\\n\\n3. **Extracting the Sequence.**  \\n   The cycle is a sequence of vertices \\\\(v_0,v_1,\\\\dots,v_E\\\\).  We only need the first \\\\(n\\\\) of them, i.e.\\\\ \\\\(v_0,\\\\dots,v_{n-1}\\\\).  We map each vertex index \\\\(v_i\\\\) to the \\\\(v_i\\\\)-th prime.  All adjacent‐products are distinct because each unordered pair \\\\(\\\\{v_i,v_{i+1}\\\\}\\\\) is used at most once in the Euler tour.\\n\\n4. **Complexity.**  \\n   - Building the adjacency is \\\\(O(k^2)\\\\).  \\n   - Running Hierholzer’s algorithm is \\\\(O(E)\\\\).  \\n   - Since \\\\(E\\\\approx\\\\tfrac12 k^2\\\\) and \\\\(k\\\\approx \\\\sqrt{2(n-1)}\\\\), the cost for one test is \\\\(O(n)\\\\).  \\n   - Summed over all tests the total \\\\(n\\\\) is \\\\(\\\\le10^6\\\\), so it easily runs within the time and memory limits.\",\n        \"refusal\": null,\n        \"role\": \"assistant\",\n        \"annotations\": [],\n        \"audio\": null,\n        \"function_call\": null,\n        \"tool_calls\": null\n      },\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"protected_material_code\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": true,\n          \"citation\": {\n            \"URL\": \"https://github.com/SergioSalazarC/CompetitiveProgrammingCodes/tree/298594ba0adf1c4ce6012035c659401d69920a84/problems%2FcodeforcesRound693D%2Fsrc%2FMain.java\",\n            \"license\": \"NOASSERTION\"\n          }\n        },\n        \"protected_material_text\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"created\": 1753310761,\n  \"model\": \"o4-mini-2025-04-16\",\n  \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n  \"service_tier\": null,\n  \"system_fingerprint\": null,\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"completion_tokens\": 12627,\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 396,\n    \"total_tokens\": 13023,\n    \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n      \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"reasoning_tokens\": 10112,\n      \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n    },\n    \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"cached_tokens\": 0\n    }\n  },\n  \"prompt_filter_results\": [\n    {\n      \"prompt_index\": 0,\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"jailbreak\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
