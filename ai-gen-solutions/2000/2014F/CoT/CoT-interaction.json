Sheriff's Defense\n\ntime limit per test2 seconds\n\nmemory limit per test256 megabytes\n\n\"Why, master,\" quoth Little John, taking the bags and weighing them in his hand, \"here is the chink of gold.\"\n\nThe folk hero Robin Hood has been troubling Sheriff of Nottingham greatly. Sheriff knows that Robin Hood is about to attack his camps and he wants to be prepared.\n\n\n\nSheriff of Nottingham built the camps with strategy in mind and thus there are exactly n\n\n camps numbered from 1\n\n to n\n\n and n−1\n\n trails, each connecting two camps. Any camp can be reached from any other camp. Each camp i\n\n has initially ai\n\n gold.\n\n\n\nAs it is now, all camps would be destroyed by Robin. Sheriff can strengthen a camp by subtracting exactly c\n\n gold from each of its neighboring camps and use it to build better defenses for that camp. Strengthening a camp doesn't change its gold, only its neighbors' gold. A camp can have negative gold.\n\n\n\nAfter Robin Hood's attack, all camps that have been strengthened survive the attack, all others are destroyed.\n\n\n\nWhat's the maximum gold Sheriff can keep in his surviving camps after Robin Hood's attack if he strengthens his camps optimally?\n\n\n\nCamp a\n\n is neighboring camp b\n\n if and only if there exists a trail connecting a\n\n and b\n\n. Only strengthened camps count towards the answer, as others are destroyed.\n\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t\n\n (1≤t≤104\n\n) — the number of test cases.\n\n\n\nEach test case begins with two integers n\n\n, c\n\n (1≤n≤2⋅105,1≤c≤109\n\n) — the number of camps and the gold taken from each neighboring camp for strengthening.\n\n\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n\n\n integers a1,a2,…,an\n\n (−109≤ai≤109\n\n) — the initial gold of each camp.\n\n\n\nThen follow n−1\n\n lines, each with integers u\n\n, v\n\n (1≤u,v≤n\n\n, u≠v\n\n) — meaning that there is a trail between u\n\n and v\n\n.\n\n\n\nThe sum of n\n\n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2⋅105\n\n.\n\n\n\nIt is guaranteed that any camp is reachable from any other camp.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nOutput a single integer, the maximum gold Sheriff of Nottingham can keep in his surviving camps after Robin Hood's attack.\n\n\n\nExample\n\nInputCopy\n\n5\n\n3 1\n\n2 3 1\n\n1 2\n\n2 3\n\n3 1\n\n3 6 3\n\n1 2\n\n2 3\n\n3 1\n\n-2 -3 -1\n\n1 2\n\n2 3\n\n6 1\n\n5 -4 3 6 7 3\n\n4 1\n\n5 1\n\n3 5\n\n3 6\n\n1 2\n\n8 1\n\n3 5 2 7 8 5 -3 -4\n\n7 3\n\n1 8\n\n4 3\n\n3 5\n\n7 6\n\n8 7\n\n2 1\n\nOutputCopy\n\n3\n\n8\n\n0\n\n17\n\n26\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, it is optimal to strengthen the second base.

We may “strengthen” any subset \\\\(S\\\\) of the camps.  Strengthening a camp \\\\(u\\\\in S\\\\) does _not_ change its own gold, but it _does_ subtract exactly \\\\(c\\\\) gold from *each* of its neighbors.  After the attack, only the strengthened camps survive; we sum the *final* gold on those camps.\\n\\nIf we choose a subset \\\\(S\\\\) of nodes, each node \\\\(u\\\\in S\\\\) ends up with\\n\\\\[\\n   a_u \\\\;-\\\\; c\\\\cdot (\\\\text{number of its neighbors that are in }S).\\n\\\\]\\nHence, if we let \\\\(\\\\deg_S(u)\\\\) be the number of neighbors of \\\\(u\\\\) also in \\\\(S\\\\), the total gold of the surviving set \\\\(S\\\\) is\\n\\n\\\\[\\n   \\\\sum_{u\\\\in S} \\\\Bigl(a_u - c\\\\cdot \\\\deg_S(u)\\\\Bigr)\\n   \\\\;=\\\\;\\n   \\\\sum_{u\\\\in S} a_u \\\\;-\\\\; c\\\\sum_{u\\\\in S}\\\\deg_S(u).\\n\\\\]\\n\\nBut in a tree each edge inside \\\\(S\\\\) contributes exactly 2 to \\\\(\\\\sum_{u\\\\in S}\\\\deg_S(u)\\\\), so\\n\\\\[\\n   \\\\sum_{u\\\\in S}\\\\deg_S(u) \\\\;=\\\\; 2\\\\cdot |E(S)|,\\n\\\\]\\nwhere \\\\(|E(S)|\\\\) is the number of edges whose both endpoints lie in \\\\(S\\\\).  Therefore the total is\\n\\\\[\\n   \\\\sum_{u\\\\in S} a_u \\\\;-\\\\; 2c\\\\cdot |E(S)|.\\n\\\\]\\n\\nWe want to pick \\\\(S\\\\) to maximize that.  This is a classic “pick a subset on a tree with a cost \\\\(2c\\\\) for every chosen edge”.  We solve it by a tree‐DP:\\n\\nRoot the tree at node \\\\(1\\\\).  For each node \\\\(u\\\\) define two DP states:\\n\\n- \\\\(\\\\mathrm{dp0}[u]\\\\): the best total sum in the subtree of \\\\(u\\\\) if we **do not** choose \\\\(u\\\\).\\n- \\\\(\\\\mathrm{dp1}[u]\\\\): the best total sum in the subtree of \\\\(u\\\\) if we **do** choose \\\\(u\\\\).\\n\\nTransitions: suppose \\\\(v\\\\) is a child of \\\\(u\\\\).  \\n\\n1. If \\\\(u\\\\) is _not_ chosen, then for each child \\\\(v\\\\) we are free to choose \\\\(v\\\\) or not, and there is no penalty on the edge \\\\(u\\\\!-\\\\!v\\\\).  Hence\\n   \\\\[\\n     \\\\mathrm{dp0}[u] \\\\;=\\\\;\\\\sum_{v\\\\text{ child of }u}\\n       \\\\max\\\\bigl(\\\\mathrm{dp0}[v],\\\\,\\\\mathrm{dp1}[v]\\\\bigr).\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n2. If \\\\(u\\\\) _is_ chosen, we gain \\\\(a_u\\\\).  For each child \\\\(v\\\\) we again may choose \\\\(v\\\\) or not, but if we choose \\\\(v\\\\) we pay an extra \\\\(2c\\\\) penalty for the edge \\\\((u,v)\\\\).  Thus\\n   \\\\[\\n     \\\\mathrm{dp1}[u]\\n     = a_u \\\\;+\\\\;\\n       \\\\sum_{v\\\\text{ child of }u}\\n         \\\\max\\\\bigl(\\\\mathrm{dp0}[v],\\\\,\\\\mathrm{dp1}[v] - 2c\\\\bigr).\\n   \\\\]\\n\\nThe answer for the whole tree is \\\\(\\\\max(\\\\mathrm{dp0}[1],\\\\,\\\\mathrm{dp1}[1])\\\\), and if that is negative we can always choose the empty set \\\\(S=\\\\varnothing\\\\) for total \\\\(0\\\\).  In fact this DP guarantees \\\\(\\\\mathrm{dp0}[1]\\\\ge0\\\\), so the final answer is \\\\(\\\\mathrm{dp0}[1]\\\\) or \\\\(\\\\mathrm{dp1}[1]\\\\).\\n\\nEach test takes \\\\(O(n)\\\\) time.  We do a single DFS (iterative) to establish a parent‐pointer array and an order of nodes so that we can fill the DP bottom‐up in \\\\(O(n)\\\\).  Since \\\\(\\\\sum n\\\\le2\\\\cdot10^5\\\\), it runs well within the time limit.\\n\\n---\\n\\n```java\\nimport java.io.*;\\nimport java.util.*;\\n\\npublic class Main {\\n    static final int MAXN = 200_000;\\n    // adjacency by forward-star (edge‐list) representation\\n    static int[] head = new int[MAXN+5], to = new int[2*(MAXN+5)], nxt = new int[2*(MAXN+5)];\\n    static int ec = 0;\\n    static long[] a = new long[MAXN+5];\\n    static long[] dp0 = new long[MAXN+5], dp1 = new long[MAXN+5];\\n    static int[] parent = new int[MAXN+5];\\n    static int[] stack = new int[MAXN+5], order = new int[MAXN+5];\\n    \\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\\n        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));\\n        StringTokenizer st;\\n        int t = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine());\\n        PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(new BufferedOutputStream(System.out));\\n        \\n        while (t-- > 0) {\\n            st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\\n            int n = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\\n            long c = Long.parseLong(st.nextToken());\\n            // read gold values\\n            st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\\n            for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\\n                a[i] = Long.parseLong(st.nextToken());\\n            }\\n            // reset graph heads\\n            for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\\n                head[i] = -1;\\n            }\\n            ec = 0;\\n            // read edges\\n            for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {\\n                st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\\n                int u = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\\n                int v = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\\n                addEdge(u, v);\\n                addEdge(v, u);\\n            }\\n            \\n            // build a DFS order and parent[], iterative\\n            int sp = 0, os = 0;\\n            stack[sp++] = 1;\\n            parent[1] = 0;\\n            while (sp > 0) {\\n                int u = stack[--sp];\\n                order[os++] = u;\\n                for (int e = head[u]; e != -1; e = nxt[e]) {\\n                    int v = to[e];\\n                    if (v == parent[u]) continue;\\n                    parent[v] = u;\\n                    stack[sp++] = v;\\n                }\\n            }\\n            \\n            // bottom‐up DP in reverse of the order\\n            for (int i = os - 1; i >= 0; i--) {\\n                int u = order[i];\\n                long best0 = 0, best1 = a[u];\\n                for (int e = head[u]; e != -1; e = nxt[e]) {\\n                    int v = to[e];\\n                    if (v == parent[u]) continue;\\n                    // If u is not chosen, we take max(dp0[v], dp1[v])\\n                    best0 += Math.max(dp0[v], dp1[v]);\\n                    // If u is chosen, we take max(dp0[v], dp1[v] - 2c)\\n                    best1 += Math.max(dp0[v], dp1[v] - 2*c);\\n                }\\n                dp0[u] = best0;\\n                dp1[u] = best1;\\n            }\\n            \\n            long ans = Math.max(dp0[1], dp1[1]);\\n            // we can always pick nothing for 0 if negative\\n            if (ans < 0) ans = 0;\\n            pw.println(ans);\\n        }\\n        \\n        pw.flush();\\n        pw.close();\\n    }\\n    \\n    static void addEdge(int u, int v) {\\n        to[ec] = v;\\n        nxt[ec] = head[u];\\n        head[u] = ec++;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Explanation of Key Steps**\\n\\n1. **Rewriting the objective.**  \\n   If you choose a subset \\\\(S\\\\), each chosen node \\\\(u\\\\) contributes\\n   \\\\[\\n     a_u \\\\;-\\\\; c\\\\cdot(\\\\text{number of its chosen neighbors}).\\n   \\\\]\\n   Because each tree‐edge inside \\\\(S\\\\) is counted twice (once at each endpoint), the total subtraction for each such edge is \\\\(2c\\\\).
