H. Sakurako's Test
time limit per test1 second

Sakurako will soon take a test. The test can be described as an array of integers n
 and a task on it:

Given an integer x
, Sakurako can perform the following operation any number of times:

Choose an integer i
 (1≤i≤n
) such that ai≥x
;
Change the value of ai
 to ai−x
.
Using this operation any number of times, she must find the minimum possible median∗
 of the array a
.

Sakurako knows the array but does not know the integer x
. Someone let it slip that one of the q
 values of x
 will be in the next test, so Sakurako is asking you what the answer is for each such x
.

∗
The median of an array of length n
 is the element that stands in the middle of the sorted array (at the n+22
-th position for even n
, and at the n+12
-th for odd)

Input
The first line contains one integer t
 (1≤t≤104
)  — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n
 and q
 (1≤n,q≤105
)  — the number of elements in the array and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n
 integers a1,a2,…,an
 (1≤ai≤n
)  — the elements of the array.

The following q
 lines each contain one integer x
 (1≤x≤n
).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n
 across all test cases does not exceed 105
. The same guarantee applies to the sum of q
 across all test cases.

Output
For each test case, output q
 integers  — the answer for each query.
