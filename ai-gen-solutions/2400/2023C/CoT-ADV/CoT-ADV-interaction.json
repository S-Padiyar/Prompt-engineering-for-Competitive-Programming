First, carefully read and restate the problem in your own words to ensure full understanding. Identify the input and output formats, list the constraints, and consider any edge cases that might affect the logic. Next, determine which algorithmic pattern the problem fits best—such as greedy, binary search, two pointers, dynamic programming, or graph traversal—and briefly explain why that pattern applies. Then, plan your solution step by step, describing the key ideas, data structures, or mathematical insights you’ll use. Once your plan is clear, write a clean and fully working Java program. Use import java.util.*; and include a Main class with a main method, using Scanner or BufferedReader for input depending on the constraints. Add comments to explain important logic in the code. After coding, walk through a sample input manually to show how your solution works in practice. Finally, analyze the time and space complexity of your approach using Big-O notation, justifying your answer. Think step by step and only write code once the logic is sound and complete."

Each vertex in each graph is labeled either *outgoing* or *incoming*.  We wish to add exactly \\\\(n\\\\) new directed edges *across* the two graphs (so no new edge stays in the same graph) so that:\\n\\n1. Each *outgoing* vertex issues exactly one of the new edges.\\n2. Each *incoming* vertex receives exactly one of the new edges.\\n3. In the combined graph (the union of \\\\(G_1\\\\), \\\\(G_2\\\\), and the new edges), every directed cycle has length divisible by \\\\(k\\\\).\\n\\nWe must decide if such a selection of \\\\(n\\\\) cross-edges is possible.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Key Observations**\\n\\n1.  Let\\n   \\\\[\\n     X_1 = \\\\#\\\\{\\\\text{outgoing vertices in }G_1\\\\},\\\\quad\\n     Y_1 = \\\\#\\\\{\\\\text{incoming vertices in }G_1\\\\},\\n   \\\\]\\n   and similarly\\n   \\\\[\\n     X_2 = \\\\#\\\\{\\\\text{outgoing in }G_2\\\\},\\\\quad\\n     Y_2 = \\\\#\\\\{\\\\text{incoming in }G_2\\\\}.\\n   \\\\]\\n   Since each outgoing must send exactly one new edge, the total number of outgoing vertices across both graphs is\\n   \\\\[\\n     X_1 + X_2 \\\\;=\\\\;\\\\text{(number of new edges)} \\\\;=\\\\; n.\\n   \\\\]\\n   Likewise by the “one incoming edge per incoming vertex” condition one checks automatically \\\\(Y_1 + Y_2 = n\\\\).  \\n   Hence a necessary condition is\\n   \\\\[\\n     (X_1 + X_2 = n).\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n2.  **Cycle‐length constraint:**  \\n    Any new cycle in the combined graph alternates some new (cross) edges with paths inside \\\\(G_1\\\\) or \\\\(G_2\\\\).  Because each path inside \\\\(G_i\\\\) has length \\\\(\\\\equiv 0\\\\pmod{k}\\\\), the only way a cycle can fail the divisibility‐by‐\\\\(k\\\\) test is if the number of *new* edges it uses, call it \\\\(t\\\\), is not divisible by \\\\(k\\\\).\\n\\n    Moreover, a classical “strong‐connectivity plus cycle‐length‐mod‐\\\\(k\\\\)” argument shows that from any cross‐edge’s endpoint you can go to *any* next cross‐edge’s start (within the same graph) with a path of length \\\\(\\\\equiv 0\\\\pmod{k}\\\\).  Hence in effect the cross‐edges alone generate a *complete bipartite* “step graph” between the outgoing sets of \\\\(G_1\\\\) and \\\\(G_2\\\\).  Such a complete bipartite digraph always has directed 2‐cycles (pick one outgoing in \\\\(G_1\\\\), one in \\\\(G_2\\\\)), so unless \\\\(k\\\\mid 2\\\\) (i.e.\\\\ \\\\(k=2\\\\)) these 2‐cycles violate the “cycle‐length divisible by \\\\(k\\\\)” requirement.\\n\\n3.  **Corner cases:**  \\n    - If \\\\(k=2\\\\), then every even cycle is fine, and these 2‐cycles are allowed.  So *as long as* \\\\(X_1+X_2=n\\\\), the answer is YES.  \\n    - If \\\\(k>2\\\\), then 2‐cycles force us to disallow *any* mixing of outgoing vertices across the two graphs.  In particular, we can only avoid building any cross‐graph 2‐cycle if all new edges go *in the same direction* (i.e.\\\\ all from \\\\(G_1\\\\to G_2\\\\) or all from \\\\(G_2\\\\to G_1\\\\)), which happens precisely when one of \\\\(X_1\\\\) or \\\\(X_2\\\\) is zero.  \\n\\nPutting together:\\n\\n- First check \\\\(X_1 + X_2 = n\\\\).  If not, print NO.\\n- Else if \\\\(k = 2\\\\), print YES.\\n- Else (\\\\(k>2\\\\)), print YES *only if* \\\\(X_1=0\\\\) or \\\\(X_2=0\\\\); otherwise NO.\\n\\nIn fact **no** information about the internal edges of \\\\(G_1\\\\) or \\\\(G_2\\\\) is needed beyond strong connectivity and the “all cycles \\\\(\\\\equiv0\\\\pmod k\\\\)” guarantee, so we can skip reading them beyond discarding input lines.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Complexities**\\n\\n- Time: \\\\(O\\\\bigl(\\\\sum n + \\\\sum (m_1+m_2)\\\\bigr)\\\\) for input reading.  The decision logic per test is \\\\(O(n+m_1+m_2)\\\\), but the graph edges are never stored nor processed further.  \\n- Space: \\\\(O(n)\\\\) for reading the two bit-arrays \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\).

We verify  \\n    a) `sumA + sumB == n` (necessary to have exactly \\\\(n\\\\) new edges, one from each outgoing).  \\n    b) If \\\\(k=2\\\\), every formed cycle will have even length, so the “cycle‐divisible‐by‐\\\\(k\\\\)” requirement is automatically satisfied.  \\n    c) If \\\\(k>2\\\\), we must avoid the existence of any 2‐cycle formed by a new edge from \\\\(G_1\\\\to G_2\\\\) and one from \\\\(G_2\\\\to G_1\\\\).  The only way to forbid *all* such 2‐cycles is to have *all* cross‐edges point in the same direction; equivalently, one of the graphs must contribute zero outgoings (i.e.\\\\ `sumA == 0` or `sumB == 0`).\\n\\nThis runs in \\\\(O(\\\\sum n + \\\\sum m)\\\\) time for input handling and constant‐time logic per test.\",\n        \"refusal\": null,\n        \"role\": \"assistant\",\n        \"annotations\": [],\n        \"audio\": null,\n        \"function_call\": null,\n        \"tool_calls\": null\n      },\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"protected_material_code\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"protected_material_text\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"created\": 1753326919,\n  \"model\": \"o4-mini-2025-04-16\",\n  \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n  \"service_tier\": null,\n  \"system_fingerprint\": null,\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"completion_tokens\": 9169,\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 1335,\n    \"total_tokens\": 10504,\n    \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n      \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"reasoning_tokens\": 7232,\n      \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n    },\n    \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"cached_tokens\": 1280\n    }\n  },\n  \"prompt_filter_results\": [\n    {\n      \"prompt_index\": 0,\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"jailbreak\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
