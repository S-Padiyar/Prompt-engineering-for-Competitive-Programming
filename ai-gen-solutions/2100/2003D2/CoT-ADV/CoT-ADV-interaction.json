Turtle and a MEX Problem (Hard Version)\n\ntime limit per test2 seconds\n\nmemory limit per test256 megabytes\n\nThe two versions are different problems. In this version of the problem, you can't choose the same integer twice or more. You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.\n\n\n\nOne day, Turtle was playing with n\n\n sequences. Let the length of the i\n\n-th sequence be li\n\n. Then the i\n\n-th sequence was ai,1,ai,2,…,ai,li\n\n.\n\n\n\nPiggy gave Turtle a problem to solve when Turtle was playing. The statement of the problem was:\n\n\n\nThere was a non-negative integer x\n\n at first. Turtle would perform an arbitrary number (possibly zero) of operations on the integer.\n\nIn each operation, Turtle could choose an integer i\n\n such that 1≤i≤n\n\n and i\n\n wasn't chosen before, and set x\n\n to mex†(x,ai,1,ai,2,…,ai,li)\n\n.\n\nTurtle was asked to find the answer, which was the maximum value of x\n\n after performing an arbitrary number of operations.\n\nTurtle solved the above problem without difficulty. He defined f(k)\n\n as the answer to the above problem when the initial value of x\n\n was k\n\n.\n\n\n\nThen Piggy gave Turtle a non-negative integer m\n\n and asked Turtle to find the value of ∑i=0mf(i)\n\n (i.e., the value of f(0)+f(1)+…+f(m)\n\n). Unfortunately, he couldn't solve this problem. Please help him!\n\n\n\n†mex(c1,c2,…,ck)\n\n is defined as the smallest non-negative integer x\n\n which does not occur in the sequence c\n\n. For example, mex(2,2,0,3)\n\n is 1\n\n, mex(1,2)\n\n is 0\n\n.\n\n\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t\n\n (1≤t≤104\n\n). The description of the test cases follows.\n\n\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers n,m\n\n (1≤n≤2⋅105,0≤m≤109\n\n).\n\n\n\nEach of the following n\n\n lines contains several integers. The first integer li\n\n (1≤li≤2⋅105\n\n) represents the length of the i\n\n-th sequence, and the following li\n\n integers ai,1,ai,2,…,ai,li\n\n (0≤ai,j≤109\n\n) represent the elements of the i\n\n-th sequence.\n\n\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n\n\n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105\n\n and the sum of ∑li\n\n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105\n\n.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single integer — the value of ∑i=0mf(i)\n\n.\n\n\n\nExample\n\nInputCopy\n\n6\n\n3 4\n\n2 0 2\n\n3 2 3 3\n\n4 7 0 1 5\n\n3 4\n\n5 0 2 0 4 11\n\n1 1\n\n5 1 3 0 3 3\n\n2 50\n\n2 1 2\n\n2 1 2\n\n1 1\n\n7 1 2 4 1 4 9 5\n\n4 114514\n\n2 2 2\n\n5 7 3 6 0 3\n\n3 0 1 1\n\n5 0 9 2 1 5\n\n5 1919810\n\n1 2\n\n2 324003 0\n\n3 1416324 2 1460728\n\n4 1312631 2 0 1415195\n\n5 1223554 192248 2 1492515 725556\n\nOutputCopy\n\n16\n\n18\n\n1281\n\n4\n\n6556785365\n\n1842836177961\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, when x\n\n is initially 2\n\n, Turtle can choose i=3\n\n and set x\n\n to mex(x,a3,1,a3,2,a3,3,a3,4)=mex(2,7,0,1,5)=3\n\n. It can be proved that Turtle can't make the value of x\n\n greater than 3\n\n, so f(2)=3\n\n.\n\n\n\nIt can be seen that f(0)=3\n\n, f(1)=3\n\n, f(2)=3\n\n, f(3)=3\n\n, and f(4)=4\n\n. So f(0)+f(1)+f(2)+f(3)+f(4)=3+3+3+3+4=16\n\n.\n\n\n\nIn the second test case, when x\n\n is initially 1\n\n, Turtle can choose i=1\n\n and set x\n\n to mex(x,a1,1,a1,2,a1,3,a1,4,a1,5)=mex(1,0,2,0,4,11)=3\n\n. It can be proved that Turtle can't make the value of x\n\n greater than 3\n\n, so f(1)=3\n\n.\n\n\n\nIt can be seen that f(0)=4\n\n, f(1)=3\n\n, f(2)=4\n\n, f(3)=3\n\n, and f(4)=4\n\n. So f(0)+f(1)+f(2)+f(3)+f(4)=4+3+4+3+4=18\n\n.\n\n\n\nIn the fourth test case, it can be seen that f(0)=3\n\n and f(1)=1\n\n. So f(0)+f(1)=3+1=4\n\n.\n\n---\n\nYou are a competitive programming assistant solving Codeforces problems using Java. First, carefully read and restate the problem in your own words to ensure full understanding. Identify the input and output formats, list the constraints, and consider any edge cases that might affect the logic. Next, determine which algorithmic pattern the problem fits best—such as greedy, binary search, two pointers, dynamic programming, or graph traversal—and briefly explain why that pattern applies. Then, plan your solution step by step, describing the key ideas, data structures, or mathematical insights you’ll use. Once your plan is clear, write a clean and fully working Java program. Use import java.util.*; and include a Main class with a main method, using Scanner or BufferedReader for input depending on the constraints. Add comments to explain important logic in the code. After coding, walk through a sample input manually to show how your solution works in practice. Finally, analyze the time and space complexity of your approach using Big-O notation, justifying your answer. Think step by step and only write code once the logic is sound and complete."

For \\\\(x\\\\ge3\\\\), \\\\(f(x)=x\\\\).\\n- Sum up to \\\\(m=4\\\\): \\\\(3+3+3+3+4 = 16\\\\).\\n\\n**Time & Space Complexity**\\n\\n- Let \\\\(L=\\\\sum_i l_i\\\\).  Preprocessing all sequences (sorting + dedup) is \\\\(O(L\\\\log L)\\\\) overall.\\n- Computing all \\\\((d_i,e_i)\\\\) and grouping is \\\\(O(L)\\\\).\\n- Building dp for \\\\(x=K-1\\\\) down to \\\\(0\\\\) is \\\\(O(K + n)\\\\) where \\\\(K\\\\le \\\\max l_i+1\\\\le L+1\\\\).\\n- Summation and output is \\\\(O(K)\\\\).\\n- Since \\\\(\\\\sum L\\\\le 2\\\\cdot10^5\\\\), every test case is overall \\\\(O(L\\\\log L + K)\\\\) amortized.  Summed over all test cases it fits well within a few hundred milliseconds.\\n\\nMemory is \\\\(O(L+K)\\\\) extra for storing groups and dp arrays, also within the problem limits.\",\n        \"refusal\": null,\n        \"role\": \"assistant\",\n        \"annotations\": [],\n        \"audio\": null,\n        \"function_call\": null,\n        \"tool_calls\": null\n      },\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"protected_material_code\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"protected_material_text\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"created\": 1753326480,\n  \"model\": \"o4-mini-2025-04-16\",\n  \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n  \"service_tier\": null,\n  \"system_fingerprint\": null,\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"completion_tokens\": 17693,\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 1429,\n    \"total_tokens\": 19122,\n    \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n      \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"reasoning_tokens\": 14720,\n      \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n    },\n    \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"cached_tokens\": 1152\n    }\n  },\n  \"prompt_filter_results\": [\n    {\n      \"prompt_index\": 0,\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"jailbreak\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
