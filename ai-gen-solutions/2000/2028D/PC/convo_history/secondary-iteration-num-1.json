Alice's Adventures in Cards\n\ntime limit per test2 seconds\n\nmemory limit per test256 megabytes\n\nAlice is playing cards with the Queen of Hearts, King of Hearts, and Jack of Hearts. There are n\n\n different types of cards in their card game. Alice currently has a card of type 1\n\n and needs a card of type n\n\n to escape Wonderland. The other players have one of each kind of card.\n\n\n\nIn this card game, Alice can trade cards with the three other players. Each player has different preferences for the n\n\n types of cards, which can be described by permutations∗\n\n q\n\n, k\n\n, and j\n\n for the Queen, King, and Jack, respectively.\n\n\n\nA player values card a\n\n more than card b\n\n if for their permutation p\n\n, pa>pb\n\n. Then, this player is willing to trade card b\n\n to Alice in exchange for card a\n\n. Alice's preferences are straightforward: she values card a\n\n more than card b\n\n if a>b\n\n, and she will also only trade according to these preferences.\n\n\n\nDetermine if Alice can trade up from card 1\n\n to card n\n\n subject to these preferences, and if it is possible, give a possible set of trades to do it.\n\n\n\n∗\n\nA permutation of length n\n\n is an array consisting of n\n\n distinct integers from 1\n\n to n\n\n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4]\n\n is a permutation, but [1,2,2]\n\n is not a permutation (2\n\n appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4]\n\n is also not a permutation (n=3\n\n but there is 4\n\n in the array).\n\n\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t\n\n (1≤t≤104\n\n). The description of the test cases follows.\n\n\n\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer n\n\n (2≤n≤2⋅105\n\n) — the number of card types.\n\n\n\nThe next three lines contain the preferences of the Queen, King, and Jack respectively. Each of these lines contains n\n\n integers p1,p2,…,pn\n\n (1≤pi≤n\n\n) — a permutation corresponding to the player's preferences.\n\n\n\nThe sum of n\n\n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105\n\n.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, on the first line output a single string \"YES\" or \"NO\" (without the quotes) denoting whether Alice can trade up to card n\n\n.\n\n\n\nIf the first line was \"YES\", then on the next line output k\n\n — the number of trades Alice will make. On the next k\n\n lines output space separated a character c∈{q,k,j}\n\n and integer x\n\n, denoting that Alice trades with player c\n\n to get card x\n\n. It must be the case that on the k\n\n'th line, x=n\n\n. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.\n\n\n\nYou can output this answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\", and \"YES\" will be recognized as positive responses. The same goes for the character c\n\n denoting the player in the trade (Q,K,J\n\n will all be accepted alongside their lowercase variants).\n\n\n\nExample\n\nInputCopy\n\n2\n\n3\n\n1 3 2\n\n2 1 3\n\n1 2 3\n\n4\n\n2 3 1 4\n\n1 2 3 4\n\n1 4 2 3\n\nOutputCopy\n\nYES\n\n2\n\nk 2\n\nq 3\n\nNO\n\nNote\n\nIn the first testcase, Alice can trade with the King to get card 2\n\n. She can then trade with the Queen to get card 3\n\n.\n\n\n\nIn the second testcase, even though Alice can trade with the Queen to get card 3\n\n, with the King to get card 2\n\n, and then with the Jack to get card 4\n\n, this is not a valid solution since it doesn't respect Alice's preferences. We can show that there is no way for Alice to get to card 4\n\n.\n\nUse Java."

    "content": "**Analysis**\n\nWe have \\(n\\) card‐types labeled \\(1,2,\\dots,n\\).  Alice starts with card 1 and wants to end up with card \\(n\\).  There are three other players–Queen, King, Jack–each of whom holds one of each card \\(1\\ldots n\\).  We are given for each player a “preference” array \\(p\\) of length \\(n\\), where \\(p[x]\\) is that player’s *value* or *utility* of card \\(x\\).  A higher \\(p[x]\\) means that player values card \\(x\\) more.\n\nA legal trade with a player \\(P\\) works like this:\n\n– Alice offers them a card \\(a\\) (the one she currently holds) and receives a card \\(b\\).  \n– The player \\(P\\) will agree if they value \\(a\\) *more* than \\(b\\); i.e.\\ \\(p[a] > p[b]\\).  In that case they trade away their copy of \\(b\\).  \n– Alice will agree only if she values \\(b\\) *more* than \\(a\\); since Alice’s value is just the label itself, she requires \\(b > a\\).\n\nHence from Alice’s current card \\(c\\) she can move to card \\(b\\) via player \\(P\\) precisely when\n\n1. \\(b > c\\), and  \n2. \\(p_P[c] > p_P[b]\\).\n\nWe want to see if there is a path from \\(1\\) to \\(n\\) in this directed graph.  If there is, we also have to output one such path (sequence of trades).\n\nA straightforward way to do a BFS on this graph would be \\(\\mathcal{O}(n^2)\\) in the worst case (because each node \\(c\\) could have \\(\\Theta(n)\\) outgoing edges).  But \\(n\\) can be up to \\(2\\times 10^5\\).  \n\nWe exploit the fact that all edges go from smaller–labeled nodes to larger–labeled nodes (\\(b>c\\)), and we only add each node \\(b\\) once to the BFS queue (the first time we discover it).  Thus each of the \\(n\\) nodes enters the queue exactly once, and each node is “removed” so that no later search tries to visit it again.  \n\nTo find efficiently, for a given \\(c\\) and a given player \\(P\\), all \\(b>c\\) with \\(p_P[b] < p_P[c]\\), we keep a segment tree over the indices \\(1\\ldots n\\).  At position \\(b\\), it stores the value \\(p_P[b]\\) if \\(b\\) is not yet visited, or \\(+\\infty\\) if \\(b\\) is already removed/visited.  Then:\n\n– In \\(\\log n\\) time we can query the minimum value of \\(p_P\\) over the range \\([c+1,\\,n]\\).  \n– If that minimum is \\(\\ge p_P[c]\\), there are no more \\(b\\) in \\([c+1,n]\\) with \\(p_P[b]<p_P[c]\\).  \n– Otherwise we can in another \\(\\log n\\) time descend the tree and find some such index \\(b\\) with \\(p_P[b]<p_P[c]\\).  \n\nEach time we find such a \\(b\\), we mark it visited, remove it from *all* three players’ segment trees (so we never visit it a second time), record \\(\\text{parent}[b]=(c,P)\\), and push \\(b\\) into the BFS queue.  \n\nSince each node is discovered and removed exactly once, the total number of segment‐tree removals is \\(3n\\), and the total number of “find‐and‐remove” steps is also \\(\\le 3n\\).  Each such step costs \\(\\mathcal{O}(\\log n)\\).  Thus the total is \\(\\mathcal{O}(n\\log n)\\), which is fine for \\(n\\) up to \\(2\\cdot10^5\\).\n\nFinally, if we have reached \\(n\\), we reconstruct the path by following the recorded parents back to \\(1\\).  If we never reached \\(n\\), we print “NO”.\n\n**Implementation in Java**\n\n```java\nimport java.io.*;\nimport java.util.*;\n\npublic class Main {\n    static final int INF = Integer.MAX_VALUE;\n    static class SegTree {\n        int n;\n        int[] st;

We start a BFS from node \\(1\\).  Once we visit a node \\(b\\), we never visit it again.\n\n3. **Segment trees to enumerate edges in \\(\\log n\\)**  \n   For each player \\(P\\), we keep a segment tree over \\(\\{1,\\dots,n\\}\\).  At position \\(b\\) it stores  \n   \\[\n     \\begin{cases}\n       p_P[b], & \\text{if }b\\text{ not yet visited},\\\\\n       +\\infty, & \\text{if }b\\text{ is visited}.\n     \\end{cases}\n   \\]\n   When handling current node \\(c\\) in the BFS, we want *all* \\(b\\in[c+1..n]\\) with \\(p_P[b] < p_P[c]\\).  We:\n\n   - Query the minimum value in \\([c+1..n]\\).  If it’s \\(\\ge p_P[c]\\), we’re done for that player.  \n   - Otherwise we locate one index \\(b\\) whose value is below \\(p_P[c]\\) (still \\(\\log n\\) time).  \n   - Remove \\(b\\) (set its value to \\(\\infty\\) in all 3 trees), record its parent pointer \\((c,P)\\), and enqueue it.  \n\n   Since each node is enqueued exactly once and removed from the trees exactly once, the total complexity is \n   \\[\n     O\\bigl(3n \\cdot \\log n\\bigr) \\;=\\; O\\bigl(n\\log n\\bigr),\n   \\]\n   which easily handles \\(n\\) up to \\(2\\times 10^5\\).\n\n4. **Reconstructing the path**  \n   Once BFS finishes, if we have visited \\(n\\), we follow the recorded parents back from \\(n\\) to \\(1\\), reverse the sequence, and print the trades.  Each trade line is of the form  \n   \\[\n     \\langle \\text{player-char}\\rangle\\;\\langle \\text{card-received}\\rangle,\n   \\]\n   where player‐char is ‘q’,‘k’, or ‘j’.\n\nThis solution runs in \\(O(n\\log n)\\) per test and supports up to \\(\\sum n \\le 2\\times 10^5\\), as required."
