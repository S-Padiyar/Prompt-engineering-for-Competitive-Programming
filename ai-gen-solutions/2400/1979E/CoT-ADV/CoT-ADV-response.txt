**Problem Restatement**

We are given n distinct points \(P_i=(x_i,y_i)\) on the plane and an even integer \(d\). We want to find three distinct indices \(i,j,k\) such that

    \(\,|x_i - x_j| + |y_i - y_j| =\)  
    \(\,|x_i - x_k| + |y_i - y_k| =\)  
    \(\,|x_j - x_k| + |y_j - y_k| = d.\)

That is, the three chosen points form an “equilateral triangle” under the Manhattan (L₁) metric, with all pairwise distances equal to \(d\). If there is any such triple, we may output it; otherwise we output `0 0 0`.

**Input**

t — number of test cases,  
for each test:  
 n (3≤n≤2⋅10⁵), d (even, 2≤d≤4⋅10⁵),  
then n lines of \(x_i,y_i\) (–10⁵≤x,y≤10⁵).

Total \(n\) over all test cases ≤2⋅10⁵.

**Output**

For each test case, either three distinct indices \(i,j,k\) of a valid Manhattan triangle of side \(d\), or `0 0 0` if none exists.

**Discussion of Approaches**

A brute‐force check of all triples is obviously \(O(n^3)\) and impossible. Even checking all pairs and then searching for the third that simultaneously has two L₁‐distances \(d\) is worst‐case \(O(n^2)\). We need something near \(O(n)\) or \(O(n\log n)\).

One clean trick that often appears is to switch from the L₁ metric in \((x,y)\) to the L∞ metric in “rotated” coordinates

\[
   s = x + y, 
   \quad
   t = x - y.
\]

One checks easily that

\[
  |x_1 - x_2| \;+\; |y_1 - y_2|
    \;=\;
  \max\!\bigl(|s_1 - s_2|,\;|t_1 - t_2|\bigr).
\]

Thus an L₁‐ball (a diamond) of radius \(d\) in \((x,y)\) becomes an L∞‐ball (an axis‐aligned square) of “radius” \(d\) in \((s,t)\), and pairwise equality of L₁‐distances becomes equality of L∞‐distances in the new plane.  One still needs to find three points in \((s,t)\) all at L∞‐distance \(d\) from each other.

A well‐known fact in the L∞ metric is that any three points which are **pairwise** at distance exactly \(d\) must lie on three (out of the four) corners of **some** axis‐aligned square of side \(d\).  Concretely, the four corners of an L∞‐ball of “radius” \(d\) around a center \((u,v)\) are
\[
    (u + d,\;v),\quad (u - d,\;v),\quad (u,\;v + d),\quad (u,\;v - d).
\]
Any three of those four corners are pairwise L∞‐distance \(d\) apart, so they form an L∞‐equilateral triangle (and hence an L₁‐equilateral triangle in the original coordinates).

Thus **algorithm**:

1. Read all points \((x_i,y_i)\) and transform to  
   \((s_i,\,t_i) = \bigl(x_i + y_i,\;x_i - y_i\bigr)\).

2. Store them in a hash‐map from the key  
   \(\,(s_i,t_i)\mapsto i\) (the original index).

3. Now for each point \((s_i,t_i)\), treat it as **potentially** the
   “bottom‐left” corner of an L∞‐square of side \(d\).   That square’s other
   corners would be  
   \[
     (s_i + d,\,t_i), 
     \quad(s_i,\,t_i + d),
     \quad(s_i + d,\,t_i + d).
   \]
   We only need the first two of these to get three corners:
   \((s_i,t_i)\), \((s_i+d,t_i)\), and \((s_i,t_i+d)\).  Any three of the four
   square‐corners will do—but testing this one pattern is enough (we will
   also test the three other “orientations” in which our point might be the
   bottom‐right, top‐left, or top‐right corner).

4. Concretely, for each point \((s_i,t_i)\) we try these four checks:  
   A) bottom‐left of square: look for  
     \((s_i + d,\, t_i)\)  and  \((s_i,\, t_i + d)\).  
   B) bottom‐right of square: look for  
     \((s_i - d,\, t_i)\)  and  \((s_i,\, t_i + d)\).  
   C) top‐left:       \((s_i + d,\, t_i)\) and \((s_i,\, t_i - d)\).  
   D) top‐right:      \((s_i - d,\, t_i)\) and \((s_i,\, t_i - d)\).  

   In each case we do two hash‐map lookups; if both exist, we have found
   three distinct input points whose pairwise L∞ distances are all \(d\),
   hence whose pairwise L₁ distances in \((x,y)\) are all \(d\).  We output
   those three indices and move on.

5. If after trying **all** points in **all** four orientations we have not
   found a valid triple, we print `0 0 0`.

This runs in \(O(n)\) hash‐map lookups per test (actually about \(8n\) lookups),
and building the map is \(O(n)\).  The overall complexity across all test
cases, given \(\sum n\le 2\cdot10^5\), is \(O(n)\) average.  Space is \(O(n)\).

**Explanation of Key Steps**

1. **Coordinate Transform**  
   We let  
   \[
     s = x + y,\quad
     t = x - y.
   \]
   It is a standard fact that
   \[
     |x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|
       = \max\!\bigl(|s_1 - s_2|,\;|t_1 - t_2|\bigr).
   \]
   Thus Manhattan distance in \((x,y)\) becomes the \(L_\infty\) (“max‐norm”)
   distance in \((s,t)\).

2. **Hash-map of Points**  
   We store each point’s \((s_i,t_i)\) in a hash‐map that returns its original
   index.  Packing two 32‐bit ints into a single 64‐bit key avoids custom
   pair‐hashing.

3. **Looking for an L∞-equilateral Triple**  
   In the \(L_\infty\) metric, three points are pairwise at distance \(d\)
   precisely if they are three of the four corners of an axis‐aligned square
   of side \(d\).  Concretely the four corners around a center \((u,v)\) are  
   \((u\pm d, v)\) and \((u, v\pm d)\).  Any three of those four are pairwise
   distance \(d\).  

   We do *not* know the center \((u,v)\).  But we do know that if a given
   input point \((s_i,t_i)\) *is* one corner, then the other two corners must
   lie at offsets \((\pm d,0)\) and \((0,\pm d)\) from it.  We therefore
   try exactly four patterns:
   - Treat \((s_i,t_i)\) as the “bottom‐left” corner ⇒ look for
     \((s_i+d,\,t_i)\) and \((s_i,\,t_i+d)\).  
   - Treat it as bottom‐right ⇒ look for \((s_i-d,\,t_i)\) and \((s_i,\,t_i+d)\).  
   - Top‐left ⇒ \((s_i+d,\,t_i)\) & \((s_i,\,t_i-d)\).  
   - Top‐right ⇒ \((s_i-d,\,t_i)\) & \((s_i,\,t_i-d)\).  

   Each pattern is just two hash‐map lookups.  If in any of the four
   orientations we find both of the needed points, we have our equilateral
   triangle of side \(d\) (in \(L_\infty\), hence in \(L_1\) it is also
   equilateral of side \(d\)).

4. **Complexities**  
   - We do \(O(n)\) work to read and transform the \(n\) points.  
   - We do \(O(n)\) to build the hash‐map.  
   - We then do up to \(4\) patterns × \(2\) lookups × \(n\) points = \(8n\)
     hash‐map operations.  
   So the total is \(O(n)\) average time per test, well within the
   \(2\!\times\!10^5\) total‐\(n\) limit.  Space is \(O(n)\) for the map and
   arrays.

**Example Walk-Through**

Take the first example from the statement:

6 4  
3 1  
0 0  
0 −2  
5 −3  
3 −5  
2 −2  

-  \(d=4\).  We transform each point \((x,y)\mapsto(s,t)=(x+y,x-y)\):

   1) (3,1)→(4,2)  
   2) (0,0)→(0,0)  
   3) (0,−2)→(−2,2)  
   4) (5,−3)→(2,8)  
   5) (3,−5)→(−2,8)  
   6) (2,−2)→(0,4)

-  Suppose we examine point 2 with \((s,t)=(0,0)\).  
  Try “bottom‐left” pattern ⇒ look for \((0+4,0)=(4,0)\) and \((0,0+4)=(0,4)\).  
  We do find \((0,4)\) as point 6, but \((4,0)\) is not in our set.  So that
  pattern fails.

-  Eventually we try point 6 \((0,4)\) in the “bottom‐right” orientation:
   look for \((0−4,4)=(−4,4)\) and \((0,4+4)=(0,8)\).  We do not have
   \((−4,4)\).  

-  Finally we try point 1 \((4,2)\) in the “bottom‐right” orientation:
   look for \((4−4,2)=(0,2)\) and \((4,2+4)=(4,6)\).  Neither is present.

-  The first successful match happens in another test iteration or pattern
   (there are several valid answers).  In the sample solution they output
   “2 6 1”, i.e.\ points 2,6,1 form a Manhattan‐equilateral triangle of side 4.

If no pattern ever succeeds, we output `0 0 0`.

---

**Time & Space Complexity**

Let \(N=\sum n\) be the total number of points over all test cases (≤2⋅10^5).

- Transforming and reading all points: \(O(N)\).  
- Inserting into the hash‐map: \(O(N)\) expected (hash operations).  
- For each point, trying up to 4 orientations × 2 lookups = 8 lookups ⇒
  \(O(N)\) more.  

Overall \(O(N)\) average time.  Memory use is \(O(N)\) for the arrays and map.

Thus the solution easily runs within the limits.
