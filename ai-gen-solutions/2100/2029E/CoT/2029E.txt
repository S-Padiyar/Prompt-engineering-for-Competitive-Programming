For two integers x
 and y
 (x,y≥2
), we will say that x
 is a generator of y
 if and only if x
 can be transformed to y
 by performing the following operation some number of times (possibly zero):

Choose a divisor d
 (d≥2
) of x
, then increase x
 by d
.
For example,

3
 is a generator of 8
 since we can perform the following operations: 3−→−d=36−→−d=28
;
4
 is a generator of 10
 since we can perform the following operations: 4−→−d=48−→−d=210
;
5
 is not a generator of 6
 since we cannot transform 5
 into 6
 with the operation above.
Now, Kevin gives you an array a
 consisting of n
 pairwise distinct integers (ai≥2
).

You have to find an integer x≥2
 such that for each 1≤i≤n
, x
 is a generator of ai
, or determine that such an integer does not exist.

Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of the input contains a single integer t
 (1≤t≤104
) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n
 (1≤n≤105
) — the length of the array a
.

The second line contains n
 integers a1,a2,…,an
 (2≤ai≤4⋅105
) — the elements in the array a
. It is guaranteed that the elements are pairwise distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n
 over all test cases does not exceed 105
.

Output
For each test case, output a single integer x
 — the integer you found. Print −1
 if there does not exist a valid x
.

If there are multiple answers, you may output any of them.

Note
In the first test case, for x=2
:

2
 is a generator of 8
, since we can perform the following operations: 2−→−d=24−→−d=48
;
2
 is a generator of 9
, since we can perform the following operations: 2−→−d=24−→−d=26−→−d=39
.
2
 is a generator of 10
, since we can perform the following operations: 2−→−d=24−→−d=26−→−d=28−→−d=210
.
In the second test case, it can be proven that it is impossible to find a common generator of the four integers.
