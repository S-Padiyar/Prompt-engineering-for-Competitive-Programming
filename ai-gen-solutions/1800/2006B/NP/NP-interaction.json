For any vertex i\n\n (1<i≤n\n\n) in the tree, there is an edge connecting vertices i\n\n and pi\n\n (1≤pi<i\n\n), with a weight equal to ti\n\n.\n\n\n\nIris does not know the values of ti\n\n, but she knows that ∑i=2nti=w\n\n and each of the ti\n\n is a non-negative integer.\n\n\n\nThe vertices of the tree are numbered in a special way: the numbers of the vertices in each subtree are consecutive integers. In other words, the vertices of the tree are numbered in the order of a depth-first search.\n\n\n\nThe tree in this picture satisfies the condition. For example, in the subtree of vertex 2\n\n, the vertex numbers are 2,3,4,5\n\n, which are consecutive integers.\n\nThe tree in this picture does not satisfy the condition, as in the subtree of vertex 2\n\n, the vertex numbers 2\n\n and 4\n\n are not consecutive integers.\n\nWe define dist(u,v)\n\n as the length of the simple path between vertices u\n\n and v\n\n in the tree.\n\n\n\nNext, there will be n−1\n\n events:\n\n\n\nIris is given integers x\n\n and y\n\n, indicating that tx=y\n\n.\n\nAfter each event, Iris wants to know the maximum possible value of dist(i,imodn+1)\n\n independently for each i\n\n (1≤i≤n\n\n). She only needs to know the sum of these n\n\n values. Please help Iris quickly get the answers.\n\n\n\nNote that when calculating the maximum possible values of dist(i,imodn+1)\n\n and dist(j,jmodn+1)\n\n for i≠j\n\n, the unknown edge weights may be different.\n\n\n\nInput\n\nEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t\n\n (1≤t≤104\n\n) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.\n\n\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers n\n\n and w\n\n (2≤n≤2⋅105\n\n, 0≤w≤1012\n\n) — the number of vertices in the tree and the sum of the edge weights.\n\n\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n−1\n\n integers p2,p3,…,pn\n\n (1≤pi<i\n\n) — the description of the edges of the tree.\n\n\n\nThen follow n−1\n\n lines indicating the events. Each line contains two integers x\n\n and y\n\n (2≤x≤n\n\n, 0≤y≤w\n\n), indicating that tx=y\n\n.\n\n\n\nIt is guaranteed that all x\n\n in the events are distinct. It is also guaranteed that the sum of all y\n\n equals w\n\n.\n\n\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n\n\n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105\n\n.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output one line containing n−1\n\n integers, each representing the answer after each event.\n\n\n\nExample\n\nInputCopy\n\n4\n\n2 1000000000000\n\n1\n\n2 1000000000000\n\n4 9\n\n1 1 1\n\n2 2\n\n4 4\n\n3 3\n\n6 100\n\n1 2 3 2 1\n\n6 17\n\n3 32\n\n2 4\n\n4 26\n\n5 21\n\n10 511\n\n1 2 2 4 2 1 1 8 8\n\n3 2\n\n6 16\n\n10 256\n\n9 128\n\n2 1\n\n5 8\n\n8 64\n\n4 4\n\n7 32\n\nOutputCopy\n\n2000000000000\n\n25 18 18\n\n449 302 247 200 200\n\n4585 4473 2681 1567 1454 1322 1094 1022 1022\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, dist(1,2)=dist(2,1)=t2=w=1012\n\n, so dist(1,2)+dist(2,1)=2⋅1012\n\n.\n\n\n\nIn the second test case, the tree after Iris found out all tx\n\n is shown below:\n\n\n\n\n\ndist(1,2)=t2\n\n, dist(2,3)=t2+t3\n\n, dist(3,4)=t3+t4\n\n, dist(4,1)=t4\n\n. After the first event, she found out that t2=2\n\n, so dist(1,2)=2\n\n. At the same time:\n\n\n\ndist(2,3)\n\n is maximized if t3=7\n\n, t4=0\n\n. Then dist(2,3)=9\n\n.\n\ndist(3,4)\n\n and dist(4,1)\n\n are maximized if t3=0\n\n, t4=7\n\n. Then dist(3,4)=dist(4,1)=7\n\n.\n\nThus, the answer is 2+9+7+7=25\n\n.\n\n\n\nAfter the second event, she found out that t4=4\n\n, then t3=w−t2−t4=4\n\n. dist(1,2)=2\n\n, dist(2,3)=2+3=5\n\n, dist(3,4)=3+4=7\n\n, dist(4,1)=4\n\n. Thus, the answer is 2+5+7+4=18\n\n.\n\n---\n\nUse Java."

Equivalently a pair \\\\((i,i+1)\\\\) is “fully known” exactly when in the forest of revealed edges the vertices \\\\(i\\\\) and \\\\(i+1\\\\) lie in the *same* connected component.\\n\\n5)  We process the edge‐reveals in the given order; each reveal adds one edge to what was previously a forest.  We keep a DSU (union‐find) on the \\\\(n\\\\) vertices, and we also want to know, when merging two components \\\\(A\\\\) and \\\\(B\\\\), how many new consecutive‐label pairs \\\\((i,i+1)\\\\) become connected “across” that merge.  But a pair \\\\((i,i+1)\\\\) only becomes connected *exactly* if \\\\(i\\\\) is in \\\\(A\\\\) and \\\\(i+1\\\\) is in \\\\(B\\\\) (or vice-versa).  \\n\\n   To count those fast, we store *for each component* the *list of its vertex‐labels*.  On a merge we iterate the *smaller* of the two lists, and for each label \\\\(x\\\\) we test\\n   ```\\n     if 1<x    and find(x-1)==other_root   then C++\\n     if    x<n and find(x+1)==other_root   then C++\\n   ```\\n   (and also handle the wraparound \\\\((n,1)\\\\) via `x+1 % n`).  Since we always iterate the smaller side, each vertex‐label moves \\\\(O(\\\\log n)\\\\) times, so the total work is \\\\(O(n\\\\log n)\\\\) per test.  With all sums of \\\\(n\\\\) over all tests \\\\(\\\\le2\\\\cdot10^5\\\\), this fits comfortably in 3 s in Java.\\n\\nPutting it all together gives an \\\\(O(n\\\\log n)\\\\)-style solution per test, which suffices for \\\\(\\\\sum n\\\\le2\\\\cdot10^5\\\\).\\n\\n---\\n\\n```java\\nimport java.io.*;\\nimport java.util.*;\\n\\npublic class Main {\\n    static int[] parent, sz, nxt, head, tail;\\n    static int n;\\n    static long W;        // total sum of weights\\n    static long S;        // sum of revealed weights\\n    static long fully;    // C = count of pairs that are already fully known\\n\\n    // DSU find with path compression\\n    static int find(int x) {\\n        return parent[x]==x ? x : (parent[x]=find(parent[x]));\\n    }\\n\\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\\n        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));\\n        PrintWriter    pw = new PrintWriter(new BufferedWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(System.out)));\\n        int t = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine().trim());\\n        while(t-- > 0) {\\n            StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\\n            n = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\\n            W = Long.parseLong(st.nextToken());\\n\\n            // read the parent array\\n            int[] p = new int[n+1];  \\n            st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\\n            for(int i=2; i<=n; i++){\\n                p[i] = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\\n            }\\n\\n            // initialize DSU\\n            parent = new int[n+1];\\n            sz     = new int[n+1];\\n            nxt    = new int[n+1];\\n            head   = new int[n+1];\\n            tail   = new int[n+1];\\n            for(int i=1; i<=n; i++){\\n                parent[i] = i;\\n                sz[i] = 1;\\n                head[i] = i;    // each comp's list is just the single label i\\n                tail[i] = i;\\n                nxt[i]  = 0;    // end of list\\n            }\\n\\n            S = 0;\\n            fully = 0;  // how many adj‐pairs are already fully known\\n            StringBuilder ans = new StringBuilder();\\n\\n            // process the n-1 events\\n            for(int e=0; e<n-1; e++){\\n                st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\\n                int x = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\\n                long w = Long.parseLong(st.nextToken());\\n                // accumulate revealed weight\\n                S += w;\\n\\n                // union the edge (p[x], x)\\n                int rx = find(x), ry = find(p[x]);\\n                if(rx != ry) {\\n                    // always merge the smaller into the larger\\n                    if(sz[rx] > sz[ry]){\\n                        int tmp=rx; rx=ry; ry=tmp;\\n                    }\\n                    // rx is smaller root, ry is larger root\\n                    // scan the labels in rx's component\\n                    int cur = head[rx];\\n                    while(cur!=0){\\n                        // check neighbor cur-1 (if >=2)\\n                        if(cur>1 && find(cur-1)==ry){\\n                            fully++;\\n                        }\\n                        // check neighbor cur+1 (mod n)\\n                        int nb = (cur==n ? 1 : cur+1);\\n                        if(find(nb)==ry){\\n                            fully++;\\n                        }\\n                        cur = nxt[cur];\\n                    }\\n                    // append rx's list to ry's list\\n                    nxt[tail[ry]] = head[rx];\\n                    tail[ry]      = tail[rx];\\n                    head[rx]      = tail[rx] = 0;\\n\\n                    // standard DSU union\\n                    parent[rx] = ry;\\n                    sz[ry]     += sz[rx];\\n                }\\n\\n                // number of adj‐pairs that still have at least one unknown edge:\\n                long unknownPairs = n - fully;\\n                long U = W - S;  // remaining total weight\\n                // answer = 2*S + unknownPairs * U\\n                long out = 2*S + unknownPairs * U;\\n                ans.append(out).append(' ');\\n            }\\n\\n            pw.println(ans.toString().trim());\\n        }\\n        pw.flush();\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Explanation of the main parts**\\n\\n1.  We keep a DSU on the \\\\(n\\\\) vertices, but also for each component we store a singly‐linked list of its **labels** (the DFS numbers, which coincide with their vertex IDs).  \\n\\n2.  On revealing an edge \\\\((p_x,x)\\\\) with weight \\\\(w\\\\), we do\\n   - `S += w;`\\n   - Union the two DSU components of \\\\(x\\\\) and \\\\(p_x\\\\).  \\n   - When merging, we always iterate the *smaller* component’s label‐list, and for each label `cur` we check its two neighbors in the cyclic label‐order (i.e. `cur-1` and `(cur % n)+1`).  If neighbor belongs to the *other* component, that adjacency \\\\((\\\\min,\\\\max)\\\\) just became fully known, so we `fully++`.  \\n   - We then link the two lists in \\\\(O(1)\\\\) by appending the smaller onto the larger.\\n\\n3.  After each event we know\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\sum_{i=1}^n c_i = 2\\\\,S,\\n\\\\quad\\n\\\\bigl|\\\\{\\\\,i:u_i>0\\\\}\\\\bigr| = n - \\\\mathrm{fully},\\n\\\\quad\\n\\\\text{and } U= W-S.\\n\\\\]\\nHence the answer is\\n\\\\[\\n2S \\\\;+\\\\;(n-\\\\mathrm{fully})\\\\,U.\\n\\\\]\\n\\nThis runs in \\\\(O(n\\\\log n)\\\\) per test (each vertex’s label moves through the smaller‐to‐larger merges at most \\\\(O(\\\\log n)\\\\) times), and the sum of all \\\\(n\\\\) over all tests is at most \\\\(2\\\\cdot10^5\\\\).
