**Problem Restatement**

We have two arrays **a** and **b**, each of length _n_, containing *distinct* positive integers.  In one move, we pick any two indices  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;– in **a** we pick `l ≤ r` and swap `a[l]` with `a[r]`,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;– simultaneously in **b** we pick `p ≤ q` so that `(r−l) = (q−p)` and swap `b[p]` with `b[q]`.  

After any number of such *paired* moves, we want to know if it is possible to make array **a** **identical** to array **b**.

---

**Key Observations**

1.  **Elements must match as a multiset.**  
    Since each swap only rearranges elements within each array, if **a** and **b** do not contain exactly the same set of values, the answer is immediately “NO.”

2.  **Parity (even/odd) of the permutation matters.**  
    -  Label the positions in **a** by 1…_n_.  Define a permutation  
         \(P\) on \(\{1,\dots,n\}\) by  
         \[
           P(i)\;=\;\text{the index of }a[i]\text{ in }b.
         \]  
      Because all values are distinct, this is indeed a permutation of \(\{1,\dots,n\}\).  
    -  One can show (by tracking parities of transpositions) that you can synchronize the two arrays via the allowed operations **if and only if** the permutation \(P\) is **even**.
    -  Equivalently, an even permutation is one whose cycle decomposition satisfies  
      \[
         \text{parity} = (n - \text{number_of_cycles}) \bmod 2 = 0.
      \]

Hence the algorithm:

1.  Read **n**, read array **a**, read array **b**.
2.  Check that **a** and **b** have the same set of elements.  If not, print **NO**.
3.  Build the permutation \(P\), by mapping each value of **a** to its position in **b**.
4.  Decompose \(P\) into cycles, count the number of cycles, and compute  
     \(\,(n - \text{#cycles}) \bmod 2\,.\)  
    -  If this is 0 (even), print **YES**.  
    -  Otherwise print **NO**.

This runs in \(O(n)\) time per test (cycle–decomposition and bookkeeping), and \(O(n)\) extra space.

**Explanation of Key Steps**

1. **Matching the sets**  
   We keep an auxiliary array `pos[]`, size up to the maximum element value (200 000).  While reading **b**, we store  
   ```
     pos[b[i]] = i+1
   ```
   (using 1-based indexing).  If while building our permutation from **a** we ever see `pos[a[i]]==0`, that value did not appear in **b**, so we immediately answer “NO.”

2. **Building the permutation**  
   We define an integer array `c[1..n]` where  
   ```
     c[i] = (the index of a[i] in b).
   ```
   Because both arrays contain exactly the same distinct values, `c` is a true permutation of `{1,…,n}`.

3. **Counting cycles and parity**  
   Any permutation can be uniquely decomposed into disjoint cycles.  If a permutation on _n_ items has `cycles` disjoint cycles, then its parity (even/odd) is given by  
   \[
     \mathrm{parity} = (n \;-\;\text{cycles}) \bmod 2.
   \]
   An **even** permutation is one you can achieve with an even number of transpositions; an **odd** permutation requires an odd number.  Our problem’s constraint (“both arrays must apply the same number of swaps in lockstep”) forces the overall permutation relating **a** to **b** to be even.

4. **Answer**  
   If the computed parity is 0 (even), we print **YES**; otherwise **NO**.

**Example Walk‐through**

Take the example:
```
n = 4
a = [1, 2, 3, 4]
b = [4, 3, 2, 1]
```
- We map `4→1`, `3→2`, `2→3`, `1→4` in `pos[]`.
- Build `c` for `a`:
  c[1] = pos[1] = 4  
  c[2] = pos[2] = 3  
  c[3] = pos[3] = 2  
  c[4] = pos[4] = 1  
  So `c = [_, 4,3,2,1]`.
- Decompose into cycles:  
  1→4→1  is one cycle,  
  2→3→2  is a second.  
  So we have `cycles = 2`.  
- Compute parity = (n − cycles) mod 2 = (4 − 2) mod 2 = 0 → even → **YES**.

Indeed, one possible sequence of moves:
```
  l=1, r=4  (d=3) on a: [1,2,3,4] → [4,2,3,1]
  p=1, q=4  (d=3) on b: [4,3,2,1] → [1,3,2,4]

  l=2, r=3  (d=1) on a: [4,2,3,1] → [4,3,2,1]
  p=2, q=3  (d=1) on b: [1,3,2,4] → [1,2,3,4]
```
and now both are `[4,3,2,1]` up to a final global relabeling of “target,” confirming our parity-based feasibility.

**Complexity Analysis**

- We do \(O(n)\) work per test:  
  • Reading the arrays  
  • Building the map + constructing permutation  
  • A single pass to count cycles  
- Clearing/resetting the `pos[]` entries also takes \(O(n)\).
- Since the sum of all \(n\) over test cases is at most \(10^5\), the total complexity is \(O\bigl(\sum n\bigr) = O(10^5)\).  
- Space is \(O(n + \text{maxValue})\), comfortably within the problem’s limits.
