Alice's Adventures in Cutting Cake\n\ntime limit per test2 seconds\n\nmemory limit per test256 megabytes\n\nAlice is at the Mad Hatter's tea party! There is a long sheet cake made up of n\n\n sections with tastiness values a1,a2,…,an\n\n. There are m\n\n creatures at the tea party, excluding Alice.\n\n\n\nAlice will cut the cake into m+1\n\n pieces. Formally, she will partition the cake into m+1\n\n subarrays, where each subarray consists of some number of adjacent sections. The tastiness of a piece is the sum of tastiness of its sections. Afterwards, she will divvy these m+1\n\n pieces up among the m\n\n creatures and herself (her piece can be empty). However, each of the m\n\n creatures will only be happy when the tastiness of its piece is v\n\n or more.\n\n\n\nAlice wants to make sure every creature is happy. Limited by this condition, she also wants to maximize the tastiness of her own piece. Can you help Alice find the maximum tastiness her piece can have? If there is no way to make sure every creature is happy, output −1\n\n.\n\n\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t\n\n (1≤t≤104\n\n). The description of the test cases follows.\n\n\n\nThe first line of each test case contains three integers n,m,v\n\n (1≤m≤n≤2⋅105\n\n; 1≤v≤109\n\n) — the number of sections, the number of creatures, and the creatures' minimum requirement for tastiness, respectively.\n\n\n\nThe next line contains n\n\n space separated integers a1,a2,…,an\n\n (1≤ai≤109\n\n) — the tastinesses of the sections.\n\n\n\nThe sum of n\n\n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105\n\n.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output the maximum tastiness Alice can achieve for her piece, or −1\n\n if there is no way to make sure every creature is happy.\n\n\n\nExample\n\nInputCopy\n\n7\n\n6 2 1\n\n1 1 10 1 1 10\n\n6 2 2\n\n1 1 10 1 1 10\n\n6 2 3\n\n1 1 10 1 1 10\n\n6 2 10\n\n1 1 10 1 1 10\n\n6 2 11\n\n1 1 10 1 1 10\n\n6 2 12\n\n1 1 10 1 1 10\n\n6 2 12\n\n1 1 1 1 10 10\n\nOutputCopy\n\n22\n\n12\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n0\n\n-1\n\nNote\n\nFor the first test case, Alice can give the first and second section as their own pieces, and then take the remaining 10+1+1+10=22\n\n tastiness for herself.

We want to cut the cake (the array) into exactly m+1 contiguous pieces, give m of those pieces to the creatures so that each of those has total tastiness ≥v, and give the one remaining piece to Alice.  Alice wants to maximize the tastiness of her piece; if it is impossible to give m pieces each ≥v, we output –1.\\n\\nEquivalently, we may view the process as follows:\\n\\n- Alice's own piece will be some contiguous subarray [l…r] (possibly empty).\\n- The rest of the array — the prefix [1…l–1] and the suffix [r+1…n] — must be chopped into exactly m contiguous segments, each of which has total sum ≥v.  \\n\\nBecause all aᵢ>0, a standard “greedy as soon as the running sum ≥v cut off a piece” produces the maximum possible number of disjoint segments of sum ≥v.  Moreover, if we can produce *more* than m such segments in the remaining parts, we can always merge some of them together without dropping below v (since merging two segments each ≥v yields a segment ≥2v ≥v).  Hence the feasibility condition is:\\n\\n> Let  \\n> &nbsp;&nbsp;P[i] = “maximum number of disjoint subarrays of sum ≥v in the prefix a[1..i]”,  \\n> &nbsp;&nbsp;S[i] = “maximum number of disjoint subarrays of sum ≥v in the suffix a[i..n]”.  \\n> Then it is possible to leave exactly m segments of sum ≥v in the complement of [l..r] if and only if  \\n> \\n> &nbsp;&nbsp;P[l–1] + S[r+1] ≥ m.  \\n\\nAmong all [l..r] satisfying that, Alice’s piece has sum  \\n  sum(a[l..r]) = pref[r] – pref[l–1],  \\nand we want its maximum.\\n\\nObservations:\\n\\n1.  All aᵢ≥1 ⇒ pref is strictly increasing ⇒ for fixed l, the best choice of r is the *largest* r for which P[l–1]+S[r+1]≥m, because extending r only increases Alice’s sum.\\n2.  We only need to check all l=1…n: compute need = m – P[l–1].  If need ≤0 then even with r=n we can satisfy the creatures, so we take r=n.  Otherwise we must find the maximum r for which S[r+1] ≥ need.  \\n3.  We precompute P[0..n] by a single left‐to‐right pass, and S[1..n+1] by a single right‐to‐left pass.  Both are O(n).  Then for each l we do one binary search on S to find the last index i with S[i]≥need and set r=i–1.  That is O(log n) per l, total O(n log n).  \\n4.  If P[n]<m, it is flat‐out impossible to find m creature‐pieces anywhere, so we output –1.  Otherwise there *is* at least the trivial solution that gives Alice an empty piece (sum=0) and uses the greedy segmentation to get ≥m pieces in the whole array; we therefore know the answer is ≥0.\\n\\nTotal over all test‐cases Σn≤2⋅10⁵, so O(Σn log n) is fine.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Java Implementation**\\n\\n```java\\nimport java.io.*;\\nimport java.util.*;\\n\\npublic class Main {\\n    static class FastReader {\\n        BufferedReader br;\\n        StringTokenizer st;\\n        FastReader(InputStream in) {\\n            br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(in));\\n        }\\n        String next() {\\n            while (st == null || !st.hasMoreTokens()) {\\n                try {\\n                    String line = br.readLine();\\n                    if (line == null) return null;\\n                    st = new StringTokenizer(line);\\n                } catch (IOException e) {\\n                    throw new RuntimeException(e);\\n                }\\n            }\\n            return st.nextToken();\\n        }\\n        int nextInt() { return Integer.parseInt(next());

Whenever `curSum ≥ v`, we “cut” a piece, increment our segment‐count, and reset `curSum=0`.  All elements are positive, so this indeed produces the *maximum* number of disjoint segments whose sums are each ≥ v.\\n\\n2. **Greedy suffix segmentation (S array).**  \\n   Similarly, scanning right to left allows us to know, for every suffix start position `i`, how many disjoint “≥ v” pieces can fit into `a[i..n]`.\\n\\n3. **Checking a candidate Alice‐piece `[l..r]`.**  \\n   If we take `[l..r]` for Alice, the creatures’ parts live in `a[1..l-1]` (prefix) and `a[r+1..n]` (suffix).  We need together at least `m` pieces of sum ≥ v, i.e.\\n   ```\\n     P[l-1] + S[r+1] ≥ m.\\n   ```\\n   For a fixed `l`, `P[l-1]` is known; we then pick the *largest* `r` for which `S[r+1] ≥ (m - P[l-1])`.  Since Alice’s sum `sum(a[l..r])` only grows as `r` grows (all aᵢ>0), the optimal `r` is that maximal one, which we find by binary‐searching on the non‐increasing array `S`.\\n\\n4. **Edge cases.**  \\n   - If `P[n] < m`, even the entire array can’t be cut into m pieces ≥ v, so we output –1.  \\n   - Otherwise giving Alice an *empty* piece is always possible (use the greedy segmentation to cover the whole array with ≥m creature‐pieces), so the answer is at least 0.  Hence after scanning all non‐empty candidates we take `max(found_ans, 0)`.\\n\\nThe overall complexity per test is O(n + n log n), and since ∑n≤2⋅10⁵ over all test cases, this easily runs in time.\",\n        \"refusal\": null,\n        \"role\": \"assistant\",\n        \"annotations\": [],\n        \"audio\": null,\n        \"function_call\": null,\n        \"tool_calls\": null\n      },\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"protected_material_code\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": true,\n          \"citation\": {\n            \"URL\": \"https://github.com/m-abdelkawy/miu_bd/tree/e6c464715de3d530db7fbdc66a67397fa82dbfd9/miu_bd%2Fsrc%2Fweek1%2Fday2%2Fassignment%2FFastScanner.java\",\n            \"license\": \"NOASSERTION\"\n          }\n        },\n        \"protected_material_text\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"created\": 1753309428,\n  \"model\": \"o4-mini-2025-04-16\",\n  \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n  \"service_tier\": null,\n  \"system_fingerprint\": null,\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"completion_tokens\": 10385,\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 737,\n    \"total_tokens\": 11122,\n    \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n      \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"reasoning_tokens\": 8128,\n      \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n    },\n    \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"cached_tokens\": 0\n    }\n  },\n  \"prompt_filter_results\": [\n    {\n      \"prompt_index\": 0,\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"jailbreak\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
