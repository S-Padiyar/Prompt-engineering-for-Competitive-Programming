Determine Winning Islands in Race\n\ntime limit per test2 seconds\n\nmemory limit per test256 megabytes\n\nMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO\n\n— Bessie the Cow, The Art of Racing on Islands\n\nTwo of Farmer John's cows, Bessie and Elsie, are planning to race on n\n\n islands. There are n−1\n\n main bridges, connecting island i\n\n to island i+1\n\n for all 1≤i≤n−1\n\n. Additionally, there are m\n\n alternative bridges. Elsie can use both main and alternative bridges, while Bessie can only use main bridges. All bridges are one way and can only be used to travel from an island with a lower index to an island with a higher index.\n\n\n\nInitially, Elsie starts on island 1\n\n, and Bessie starts on island s\n\n. The cows alternate turns, with Bessie making the first turn. Suppose the cow is on island i\n\n. During a cow's turn, if there are any bridges connecting island i\n\n to island j\n\n, then the cow can move to island j\n\n. Then, island i\n\n collapses, and all bridges connecting to island i\n\n also collapse. Also, note the following:\n\n\n\nIf there are no bridges connecting island i\n\n to another island, then island i\n\n collapses, and this cow is eliminated from the race.\n\nIf the other cow is also on island i\n\n, then after this cow moves to another island, the island collapses, and the other cow is eliminated from the race.\n\nAfter an island or bridge collapses, no cows may use them.\n\nIf a cow is eliminated, their turn is skipped for the rest of the race.\n\nThe race ends once either cow reaches island n\n\n. It can be shown that regardless of the cows' strategies, at least one cow reaches island n\n\n. Bessie wins if and only if she reaches island n\n\n first.\n\n\n\nFor each 1≤s≤n−1\n\n, determine whether Bessie wins if she starts the race on island s\n\n. Assume both cows follow optimal strategies to ensure their own respective victories.\n\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains t\n\n (1≤t≤104\n\n) – the number of test cases.\n\n\n\nThe first line of each test case contains n\n\n and m\n\n (2≤n≤2⋅105\n\n, 0≤m≤2⋅105\n\n) – the number of islands and the number of alternative bridges.\n\n\n\nThe next m\n\n lines of each test case contain u\n\n and v\n\n (1≤u<v≤n\n\n) – the islands that the alternative bridge connects. It is guaranteed all alternative bridges are distinct, and they do not coincide with the main bridges.\n\n\n\nIt is guaranteed that neither the sum of n\n\n nor the sum of m\n\n over all test cases exceeds 2⋅105\n\n.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a binary string of length n−1\n\n on a new line. The i\n\n'th character is 1\n\n if it is possible for Bessie to win if she starts on island i\n\n. Otherwise, it is 0\n\n.\n\n\n\nExample\n\nInputCopy\n\n5\n\n6 0\n\n6 1\n\n2 6\n\n6 1\n\n1 5\n\n10 4\n\n1 3\n\n1 6\n\n2 7\n\n3 8\n\n15 3\n\n2 8\n\n4 9\n\n8 15\n\nOutputCopy\n\n11111\n\n11011\n\n10011\n\n100001111\n\n11000111000111\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, there are no alternative bridges for Elsie to overtake Bessie and reach island n\n\n first, so Bessie will win on all islands because she always moves first.\n\n\n\nIn the second case, Bessie will lose if she starts on island 3\n\n because:\n\n\n\nBessie's Turn: Take a main bridge from island 3\n\n to island 4\n\n.\n\nElsie's Turn: Take a main bridge from island 1\n\n to island 2\n\n.\n\nBessie's Turn: Take a main bridge from island 4\n\n to island 5\n\n.\n\nElsie's Turn: Take an alternative bridge from island 2\n\n to island 6\n\n. Elsie reaches island n\n\n first.\n\n---\n\nYou are a competitive programming assistant solving Codeforces problems using Java. First, carefully read and restate the problem in your own words to ensure full understanding. Identify the input and output formats, list the constraints, and consider any edge cases that might affect the logic. Next, determine which algorithmic pattern the problem fits best—such as greedy, binary search, two pointers, dynamic programming, or graph traversal—and briefly explain why that pattern applies. Then, plan your solution step by step, describing the key ideas, data structures, or mathematical insights you’ll use. Once your plan is clear, write a clean and fully working Java program. Use import java.util.*; and include a Main class with a main method, using Scanner or BufferedReader for input depending on the constraints. Add comments to explain important logic in the code. After coding, walk through a sample input manually to show how your solution works in practice. Finally, analyze the time and space complexity of your approach using Big-O notation, justifying your answer. Think step by step and only write code once the logic is sound and complete."

This already tells us: if Elsie can reach \\\\(n\\\\) in at most \\n   \\\\[\\n     (n-s)-1\\n   \\\\]\\n   edges, then Elsie arrives _before_ Bessie and so Elsie wins.  \\n\\n3.  **The “collapse‐and‐ambush”** effect could in principle let Elsie intercept Bessie on some island \\\\(i<n\\\\) and kill her by moving off \\\\(i\\\\).  But it turns out that, because Bessie _must_ collapse island \\\\(s\\\\) on her very first turn, then \\\\(s+1\\\\) on her second turn, etc., any island on Bessie’s main path\\n   \\\\[\\n     s \\\\to s+1\\\\to\\\\cdots\\n   \\\\]\\n   is destroyed _before_ Elsie can ever use it, unless Elsie jumps over it in one direct alternative move.  A shortest‐path BFS from 1 already models the _least\\\\_ number of edges Elsie needs to jump to each island, and the only subtlety is that Elsie must not “land” on a collapsed island.  One can show that this “no‐land” constraint exactly forces us to look at, for each vertex \\\\(i\\\\), the _minimum predecessor_ of \\\\(i\\\\) on any shortest path.  \\n\\n4.  **Computing the forbidden intervals**  \\n   -  Let \\\\(\\\\mathrm{dist}[i]\\\\) = BFS distance of \\\\(i\\\\) from 1.  \\n   -  Among _all_ shortest paths (length \\\\(\\\\mathrm{dist}[i]\\\\)) from 1 to \\\\(i\\\\), let\\n      \\\\[\\n        \\\\mathrm{predMin}[i] \\n        \\\\;=\\\\;\\n        \\\\min\\\\{\\\\,u\\\\mid \\\\text{there is a shortest‐path }1\\\\to\\\\cdots\\\\to u\\\\to i\\\\}\\\\!,\\n      \\\\]\\n     i.e.\\\\ the _smallest_ index of the vertex just _before_ \\\\(i\\\\) on some shortest path.  \\n\\n   On such a shortest path of length \\\\(d=\\\\mathrm{dist}[i]\\\\), the second‐to‐last vertex is \\\\(\\\\ge\\\\mathrm{predMin}[i]\\\\).  One can show that Elsie can _intercept_ Bessie on island \\\\(i\\\\) exactly for starting‐positions \\\\(s\\\\) in the _integer interval_\\n   \\\\[\\n     \\\\bigl[\\\\;\\\\mathrm{predMin}[i]+1 \\\\;,\\\\; i \\\\;-\\\\;\\\\mathrm{dist}[i]\\\\;-\\\\;1\\\\bigl].\\n   \\\\]\\n   Whenever that interval is nonempty and includes some \\\\(s\\\\), Elsie can either  \\n   - jump onto \\\\(i\\\\) in \\\\(\\\\mathrm{dist}[i]\\\\) edges _before_ Bessie does, or  \\n   - land on the unique predecessor \\\\(\\\\mathrm{predMin}[i]\\\\) and on her next move kill Bessie by collapsing \\\\(i\\\\).  \\n\\n   Hence for each \\\\(i\\\\) with a valid interval \\\\([L_i,R_i]\\\\), _any_ \\\\(s\\\\in[L_i,R_i]\\\\) is a losing start for Bessie.  \\n\\n5.  Finally we do a range‐addition / prefix‐sum sweep over all these intervals.  We keep an integer array \\\\(\\\\text{diff}[\\\\,]\\\\) of length \\\\(n+2\\\\) initialized to 0.  For each valid interval \\\\([L,R]\\\\) with \\\\(1\\\\le L\\\\le R\\\\le n-1\\\\) we do\\n   \\\\[\\n     \\\\text{diff}[L]++,\\\\quad \\\\text{diff}[R+1]--.\\n   \\\\]\\n   Then a single pass accumulates \\\\(\\\\text{cover}[s]=\\\\sum_{j\\\\le s}\\\\text{diff}[j]\\\\).  Wherever \\\\(\\\\text{cover}[s]>0\\\\), it means \\\\(s\\\\) lies in _some_ losing interval \\\\(\\\\Rightarrow\\\\) Bessie loses \\\\(\\\\Rightarrow\\\\) print '0'.

A single BFS from node 1 gives `dist[i] =` the minimum number of edges from 1 to \\\\(i\\\\).  \\n\\n2. **Find `predMin[i]`**  \\n   Among _all_ shortest paths of length `dist[i]` from 1 to \\\\(i\\\\), let  \\n   \\\\[\\n     \\\\mathrm{predMin}[i]\\\\;=\\\\;\\\\min\\\\{\\\\,u : \\\\text{there is a shortest path }1\\\\to\\\\cdots\\\\to u\\\\to i\\\\}\\\\!.\\n   \\\\]  \\n   This is computed by a simple DP over distance‐layers: for each layer \\\\(d\\\\), for each node \\\\(u\\\\) with `dist[u] = d`, we relax all edges \\\\(u\\\\to v\\\\) that go to `dist[v] = d+1` by  \\n   ``` \\n     predMin[v] = min(predMin[v], u)\\n   ```\\n\\n3. **Derive each losing interval**  \\n   A standard combinatorial‐game / “collapse” argument shows that _any_ starting \\\\(s\\\\) in  \\n   \\\\[\\n     \\\\bigl[\\\\mathrm{predMin}[i]{+}1\\\\,,\\\\,i - \\\\mathrm{dist}[i] - 1\\\\bigr]\\n   \\\\]  \\n   is one in which Elsie can either  \\n   - intercept island \\\\(i\\\\) _before_ Bessie gets there, or  \\n   - land on the unique shortest‐path predecessor \\\\(\\\\mathrm{predMin}[i]\\\\) and kill Bessie by collapsing \\\\(i\\\\) next.  \\n\\n4. **Mark intervals via a difference array**  \\n   We build an array `diff[1..n]` so that adding +1 at `L` and –1 at `R+1` marks the half‐open interval \\\\([L,R]\\\\).  A final prefix‐sum gives at each \\\\(s\\\\) the count of how many intervals cover \\\\(s\\\\).  If that count is positive, Bessie _loses_ (we print ‘0’); if zero, Bessie _wins_ (print ‘1’).  \\n\\nOverall, each test runs in \\\\(O(n+m)\\\\) time (BFS + one more pass over edges + one pass to accumulate intervals), which easily handles \\\\(\\\\sum(n+m)\\\\le2\\\\times10^5\\\\).\",\n        \"refusal\": null,\n        \"role\": \"assistant\",\n        \"annotations\": [],\n        \"audio\": null,\n        \"function_call\": null,\n        \"tool_calls\": null\n      },\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"protected_material_code\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"protected_material_text\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"created\": 1753326654,\n  \"model\": \"o4-mini-2025-04-16\",\n  \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n  \"service_tier\": null,\n  \"system_fingerprint\": null,\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"completion_tokens\": 20743,\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 1099,\n    \"total_tokens\": 21842,\n    \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n      \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"reasoning_tokens\": 17600,\n      \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n    },\n    \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"cached_tokens\": 0\n    }\n  },\n  \"prompt_filter_results\": [\n    {\n      \"prompt_index\": 0,\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"jailbreak\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
