Hungry Games\n\ntime limit per test2 seconds\n\nmemory limit per test256 megabytes\n\nYaroslav is playing a computer game, and at one of the levels, he encountered n\n\n mushrooms arranged in a row. Each mushroom has its own level of toxicity; the i\n\n-th mushroom from the beginning has a toxicity level of ai\n\n. Yaroslav can choose two integers 1≤l≤r≤n\n\n, and then his character will take turns from left to right to eat mushrooms from this subsegment one by one, i.e., the mushrooms with numbers l,l+1,l+2,…,r\n\n.\n\n\n\nThe character has a toxicity level g\n\n, initially equal to 0\n\n. The computer game is defined by the number x\n\n — the maximum toxicity level at any given time. When eating a mushroom with toxicity level k\n\n, the following happens:\n\n\n\nThe toxicity level of the character is increased by k\n\n.\n\nIf g≤x\n\n, the process continues; otherwise, g\n\n becomes zero and the process continues.\n\nYaroslav became interested in how many ways there are to choose the values of l\n\n and r\n\n such that the final value of g\n\n is not zero.

For any subsegment [l…r] we simulate:\\n\\n- Start g:=0.\\n- For i from l to r:\\n  - g += aᵢ\\n  - if g > x, then “reset” g:=0 and continue.\\n\\nWe want the number of subsegments whose final g ≠ 0.  Equivalently, we can count the total number of subsegments minus the number of “bad” subsegments that end in a reset (so g becomes 0 right at the last element).\\n\\nIt turns out that for a fixed starting index i, one can precompute the sequence of reset‐positions that occur if you keep extending the segment, and each of those reset‐positions corresponds to exactly one bad subsegment ending there.\\n\\nConcretely, define\\n\\nB[i] = the smallest index j ≥ i such that ∑_{k=i}^j aₖ > x,\\n       or “∞” if no such j exists.\\n\\nIf B[i] ≤ n then appending [i…B[i]] is a bad segment (because at B[i] you cross x and reset).  But when you continue past B[i], your next “start” is B[i]+1, and you look up B[B[i]+1], and so on.  Hence from each i you follow a chain\\n\\n i → B[i]+1 → B[B[i]+1]+1 → ⋯\\n\\nand each jump corresponds to one reset (one bad segment).  Because B[i] ≥ i always, these pointers go strictly forward, and there are no cycles; we can DP from right to left to count how many steps each i can make before falling off the end.\\n\\nOverall:\\n\\n1. Use a two‐pointer (sliding‐window) technique to compute B[i] for all i in O(n).\\n2. Build nxt[i] = B[i]+1 if B[i]≤n, or 0 otherwise.\\n3. In decreasing i from n…1, let\\n       depth[i] = (nxt[i]>0 ? 1 + depth[nxt[i]] : 0).\\n   This is the number of bad‐subsegments starting at i.\\n4. Sum up all depth[i] to get total_bad.\\n5.

By maintaining a “right” pointer r and the current window‐sum of a[i…r-1], we can in total O(n) time move r forward at most n times, and slide the window’s left side from i to i+1.\\n\\n2. **Building the jump‐array `nxt`:**  \\n   If from position i the first reset happens at B[i], then immediately after that reset we start afresh at index B[i]+1.  Hence we set\\n   ```\\n     nxt[i] = (B[i] ≤ n ? B[i] + 1 : 0)\\n   ```\\n   A zero in `nxt` means “no more resets”.\\n\\n3. **DP to count resets (`depth[i]`):**  \\n   Because each reset from i gives you one “bad” segment, plus you jump to `nxt[i]` and count its resets, we do\\n   ```\\n     depth[i] = (nxt[i] == 0 ? 0 : 1 + depth[nxt[i]] )\\n   ```\\n   Going from right to left ensures `depth[nxt[i]]` is already known.\\n\\n4. **Answer extraction:**  \\n   The total number of subsegments is n(n+1)/2.  All “bad” subsegments are exactly those that end in a reset, and we have counted them in `totalBad`.  So the number of good subsegments is \\n   ```\\n     totalSub – totalBad.\\n   ```\\n   This matches the required count of final g ≠ 0.\",\n        \"refusal\": null,\n        \"role\": \"assistant\",\n        \"annotations\": [],\n        \"audio\": null,\n        \"function_call\": null,\n        \"tool_calls\": null\n      },\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"protected_material_code\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"protected_material_text\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"created\": 1753309356,\n  \"model\": \"o4-mini-2025-04-16\",\n  \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n  \"service_tier\": null,\n  \"system_fingerprint\": null,\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"completion_tokens\": 8034,\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 634,\n    \"total_tokens\": 8668,\n    \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n      \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"reasoning_tokens\": 6336,\n      \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n    },\n    \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"cached_tokens\": 0\n    }\n  },\n  \"prompt_filter_results\": [\n    {\n      \"prompt_index\": 0,\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"jailbreak\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
