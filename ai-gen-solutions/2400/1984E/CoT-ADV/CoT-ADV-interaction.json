Shuffle\n\ntime limit per test2 seconds\n\nmemory limit per test256 megabytes\n\nTwo hungry red pandas, Oscar and Lura, have a tree T\n\n with n\n\n nodes. They are willing to perform the following shuffle procedure on the whole tree T\n\n exactly once. With this shuffle procedure, they will create a new tree out of the nodes of the old tree.\n\n\n\nChoose any node V\n\n from the original tree T\n\n. Create a new tree T2\n\n, with V\n\n as the root.\n\nRemove V\n\n from T\n\n, such that the original tree is split into one or more subtrees (or zero subtrees, if V\n\n is the only node in T\n\n).\n\nShuffle each subtree with the same procedure (again choosing any node as the root), then connect all shuffled subtrees' roots back to V\n\n to finish constructing T2\n\n.\n\nAfter this, Oscar and Lura are left with a new tree T2\n\n. They can only eat leaves and are very hungry, so please find the maximum number of leaves over all trees that can be created in exactly one shuffle.\n\n\n\nNote that leaves are all nodes with degree 1\n\n. Thus, the root may be considered as a leaf if it has only one child.\n\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t\n\n (1≤t≤104\n\n) — the number of test cases.\n\n\n\nThe first line of every test case contains a single integer n\n\n (2≤n≤2⋅105\n\n) — the number of nodes within the original tree T\n\n.\n\n\n\nThe next n−1\n\n lines each contain two integers u\n\n and v\n\n (1≤u,v≤n\n\n) — an edge within the original tree T\n\n. The given edges form a tree.\n\n\n\nThe sum of n\n\n over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅105\n\n.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single integer — the maximum number of leaves achievable with exactly one shuffle procedure on the whole tree.\n\n\n\nExample\n\nInputCopy\n\n4\n\n5\n\n1 2\n\n1 3\n\n2 4\n\n2 5\n\n5\n\n1 2\n\n2 3\n\n3 4\n\n4 5\n\n6\n\n1 2\n\n1 3\n\n1 4\n\n1 5\n\n1 6\n\n10\n\n9 3\n\n8 1\n\n10 6\n\n8 5\n\n7 8\n\n4 6\n\n1 3\n\n10 1\n\n2 7\n\nOutputCopy\n\n4\n\n3\n\n5\n\n6\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, it can be shown that the maximum number of leaves is 4\n\n. To accomplish this, we can start our shuffle with selecting node 3\n\n as the new root.\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we are left only with one subtree, in which we can select node 2\n\n to be the new root of that subtree.\n\n\n\nThis will force all 3\n\n remaining nodes to be leaves, and once we connect them back to our new root, the shuffled subtree looks like this:\n\n\n\nWe connect the shuffled subtree back to our new root of our new tree. Our final tree has four leaves (including the root), and looks like this:\n\n\n\nIn our second test case, we have a line of five nodes. It can be shown that the maximum number of leaves after one shuffle is 3\n\n. We can start off with node 2\n\n, which forces node 1\n\n to become a leaf. Then, if we select node 4\n\n on the right side, we will also have nodes 3\n\n and 5\n\n as leaves.\n\n\n\nThe third test case is a star graph with six nodes. The number of leaves cannot increase, thus our answer will be 5\n\n (if we start the shuffling with the original root node).\n\n---\n\nYou are a competitive programming assistant solving Codeforces problems using Java. First, carefully read and restate the problem in your own words to ensure full understanding. Identify the input and output formats, list the constraints, and consider any edge cases that might affect the logic. Next, determine which algorithmic pattern the problem fits best—such as greedy, binary search, two pointers, dynamic programming, or graph traversal—and briefly explain why that pattern applies. Then, plan your solution step by step, describing the key ideas, data structures, or mathematical insights you’ll use. Once your plan is clear, write a clean and fully working Java program. Use import java.util.*; and include a Main class with a main method, using Scanner or BufferedReader for input depending on the constraints. Add comments to explain important logic in the code. After coding, walk through a sample input manually to show how your solution works in practice. Finally, analyze the time and space complexity of your approach using Big-O notation, justifying your answer. Think step by step and only write code once the logic is sound and complete."

We perform exactly one “shuffle” on the whole tree, which is a recursive procedure that\\n\\n 1. Picks a node _v_ as the “root” of the current component.\\n 2. Deletes _v_, which splits the current component into its connected sub‐components.\\n 3. Recursively shuffles each sub‐component, obtaining a new tree for each.\\n 4. Attaches each sub‐tree’s root back to _v_ to form the new tree.\\n\\nWe then count leaves in the resulting tree (an undirected tree leaf is any node of degree 1; the very root can also count as a leaf if it ends up with only one child).  We want to choose our single top‐level shuffle (i.e. choose the top‐level root) and all the recursive root‐choices underneath so as to **maximize** the number of leaves in the final tree.\\n\\nA key observation is that every node that is used as a “root” of a component of size ≥ 2 ends up having degree ≥ 2 in the final tree (and so is _not_ a leaf), _except_ possibly the global root itself: if we choose as global root a node of original degree ≤ 1, then in the final tree it will have degree 1 (one child) and _will_ count as a leaf.  All other nodes used as a root of a larger component are forced to have at least two neighbours (its “parent” plus one or more component‐roots attached), so they cannot be leaves.\\n\\nOn the other hand, every node that _never_ served as a root of a component of size ≥ 2 becomes an “isolated singleton” at some stage of the recursion and hence is _exactly_ a leaf in the final tree.\\n\\nIt follows that the resulting number of leaves can be written as\\n\\n    (# of nodes that never serve as a non‐singleton root)\\n   + (1 if the global root we chose has original degree ≤ 1, since then it also ends up as a leaf).\\n\\nMoreover, one can show (via a small combinatorial argument or by analogy to minimal vertex‐covers versus maximal matchings) that finding the minimum possible number of nodes that _do_ serve as roots of size‐≥2 components is equivalent to finding a **maximum matching** in the tree.  Indeed, if you choose any vertex‐cover of the tree of minimum size, then every edge has at least one endpoint in that cover; one can think of those vertices as the forced internal nodes, and the leftover vertices become singleton components (leaves).  And in any bipartite graph (a tree is bipartite), the size of a minimum vertex‐cover equals the size of a maximum matching.  \\n\\nHence one shows:\\n\\n 1.  If we cut the chosen global root _v_ out, the tree splits into components \\\\(C_1,C_2,\\\\dots,C_d\\\\).  \\n 2.  In each component \\\\(C_i\\\\) we can force exactly \\\\(\\\\mathrm{MM}(C_i)\\\\) nodes to be “internal” (these correspond to a minimum vertex‐cover in \\\\(C_i\\\\), i.e. the size of a maximum matching in \\\\(C_i\\\\)).  \\n 3.  All other nodes in \\\\(C_i\\\\) become leaves.  \\n 4.  Finally, if the global root has original degree ≤ 1, it also ends up as a leaf (otherwise it is not a leaf).\\n\\nThus, if we denote by \\\\(\\\\mathrm{MM}(T)\\\\) the size of the maximum matching of a tree \\\\(T\\\\), and if we pick as top‐level root \\\\(v\\\\), then\\n\\n-  The number of internal nodes used in the shuffle is\\n     \\n     1 (for the chosen root, since the top‐level root must be “used”)\\n     +∑_{i=1}^d MM(C_i) \\n     \\n  (where \\\\(C_1,\\\\dots,C_d\\\\) are the components after deleting \\\\(v\\\\)).\\n\\n-  Therefore the total leaves in the final tree are\\n     \\n     n – [ 1 + ∑ MM(C_i ) ]\\n     + (1 if deg(v)≤1, else 0).\\n\\n  If deg(v)≥2, you _cannot_ count the root itself as a leaf, so you do _not_ add the extra 1.  \\n  If deg(v)≤1, you _can_—so you add the +1 back.\\n\\nWe would like to pick \\\\(v\\\\) so as to _maximize_ that leaf‐count.  Equivalently, we need to _minimize_ the sum of the matchings of its deleted‐components,\\n\\n   ∑_{u ∈ N(v)} MM( component of T when edge (v,u) is removed )\\n\\nwhere \\\\(N(v)\\\\) are the original neighbors of \\\\(v\\\\).  Denote for each directed edge \\\\((u→v)\\\\), \\\\(\\\\mathrm{mm}_{u→v}\\\\) = the maximum matching of the component that contains \\\\(u\\\\) when we delete the edge \\\\(u–v\\\\).  \\n\\nThen for each node \\\\(v\\\\),\\n\\n  -  sum_mm_adj[v] = ∑_{u∈N(v)} mm_{u→v}  \\n  -  if deg(v)≥2, #leaves = n − 1 − sum_mm_adj[v].  \\n  -  otherwise (deg(v)≤1), #leaves = n − sum_mm_adj[v].  \\n\\nWe pick the maximum over all \\\\(v\\\\).\\n\\nSo the algorithm becomes:\\n\\n1.  Root the tree arbitrarily at node 1 and do a **tree‐DP** to compute for each node _u_:\\n\\n   dp0[u] = ∑_{c child of u} dp_best[c],  \\n   diff[c] = dp0[c] + 1 – dp_best[c],  take the best two such diffs among the children of u,  \\n   dp_best[u] = max(dp0[u], dp0[u] + max(0, best_child_diff)).\\n\\n   Here dp_best[u] = the size of the maximum matching in the _subtree_ rooted at _u_ when cut off from its parent.\\n\\n2.  Then do a classic **reroot‐DP** or one BFS‐pass to propagate the “outside” matching‐size to each child:\\n\\n   -  We carry for each node _u_ the pair (up_dp0[u], up_best[u]) that describe the matching‐size of the component “above” u (the rest of the tree outside u’s parent‐edge).  \\n   -  Then for each child _c_ of u we can compute that same pair for _c_ by _excluding_ c’s contribution from the sums at u, and recomputing a local best.  \\n\\n   After that pass we have, for **every** directed edge \\\\((u→v)\\\\), the matching size of the component on the _u_ side when \\\\((u–v)\\\\) is cut.\\n\\n3.  Finally we compute for each node v:\\n\\n     sum_mm_adj[v] = ∑_{u∈N(v)} mm_{u→v}\\n     if deg(v)≥2, leaves(v) = n – 1 – sum_mm_adj[v]\\n                else  leaves(v) = n – sum_mm_adj[v].\\n\\n   Return the maximum of leaves(v) over v.\\n\\nAll steps run in O(n).  The first is a single post‐order pass, the second is essentially one BFS/level‐order pass, and the final is O(n).  Matching‐DP on a tree is standard: dp0[u] = sum of children’s dp_best; then dp_best[u] = either match u to _one_ child (gain = 1 + dp0[that child] – dp_best[that child]) or leave u unmatched.\\n\\n---\\n\\n```java\\nimport java.io.*;\\nimport java.util.*;\\n\\npublic class Main {\\n    static int N;\\n    static List<Integer>[] adj;\\n    static int[] parent, deg;\\n    static int[] order;       // BFS order\\n    static int[] dp0, dpBest; // dp0[u] = sum dpBest[children], dpBest[u] = best matching in subtree u\\n    // For each u we keep the two largest \\\"diff\\\" values over its children:\\n    static int[] diff1, diff2, diff1Id;\\n    // For reroot:\\n    static int[] upDp0, upBest, diffParent;\\n    static long[] sumMmAdj;\\n\\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\\n        BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));\\n        StringTokenizer tk = new StringTokenizer(in.readLine());\\n        int t = Integer.parseInt(tk.nextToken());\\n        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\\n\\n        while (t-- > 0) {\\n            tk = new StringTokenizer(in.readLine());\\n            N = Integer.parseInt(tk.nextToken());\\n            // Build adjacency\\n            adj = new ArrayList[N+1];\\n            for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {\\n                adj[i] = new ArrayList<>();\\n            }\\n            for (int i = 1; i < N; i++) {\\n                tk = new StringTokenizer(in.readLine());\\n                int u = Integer.parseInt(tk.nextToken());\\n                int v = Integer.parseInt(tk.nextToken());\\n                adj[u].add(v);\\n                adj[v].add(u);\\n            }\\n\\n            // Prepare arrays\\n            parent = new int[N+1];\\n            order  = new int[N];\\n            deg    = new int[N+1];\\n            for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {\\n                deg[i] = adj[i].size();\\n            }\\n\\n            // 1) BFS to get a parent[] and an order[] by increasing depth\\n            Queue<Integer> q = new ArrayDeque<>();\\n            q.add(1);\\n            parent[1] = 0;\\n            int idx = 0;\\n            while (!q.isEmpty()) {\\n                int u = q.poll();\\n                order[idx++] = u;\\n                for (int w: adj[u]) {\\n                    if (w == parent[u]) continue;\\n                    parent[w] = u;\\n                    q.add(w);\\n                }\\n            }\\n\\n            // 2) Post‐order DP to compute, for each u, the matching on the subtree rooted at u\\n            dp0 = new int[N+1];\\n            dpBest = new int[N+1];\\n            diff1 = new int[N+1];\\n            diff2 = new int[N+1];\\n            diff1Id = new int[N+1];\\n\\n            // Process in reverse BFS‐order so children come before parent\\n            for (int i = N-1; i >= 0; i--) {\\n                int u = order[i];\\n                // Sum up children's dpBest\\n                int sum0 = 0;\\n                int best1 = 0, best2 = 0, best1id = -1;\\n                for (int w: adj[u]) {\\n                    if (w == parent[u]) continue;\\n                    sum0 += dpBest[w];\\n                }\\n                // compute diffs for each child\\n                for (int w: adj[u]) {\\n                    if (w == parent[u]) continue;\\n                    int d = dp0[w] + 1 - dpBest[w];\\n                    // track top two\\n                    if (d > best1) {\\n                        best2 = best1;\\n                        best1 = d;\\n                        best1id = w;\\n                    } else if (d > best2) {\\n                        best2 = d;\\n                    }\\n                }\\n                dp0[u] = sum0;\\n                diff1[u] = best1;\\n                diff2[u] = best2;\\n                diff1Id[u] = best1id >= 0 ?

A BFS pass builds  \\n   - `parent[u]` = the parent of _u_ in that arbitrary root‐1 tree  \\n   - `order[]` = the nodes in BFS‐order (by increasing depth)\\n\\n2. **Postorder DP to compute subtree‐matching**  \\n   In reverse BFS‐order (i.e. deepest nodes first), we compute for each node _u_  \\n   - `dp0[u]` = ∑ `dpBest[c]` over all children c of _u_ (the sum of best‐matchings in each child‐subtree)  \\n   - for each child c, we form a “profit if we match u–c” = `dp0[c] + 1 − dpBest[c]`, and we keep the top two profits for all children.  \\n   - `dpBest[u]` = max of  \\n     - *not matching u to any child*: `dp0[u]`  \\n     - *matching u to exactly one child*: `dp0[u] + max(0, highestProfit)`\\n\\n   By standard tree‐matching DP, `dpBest[u]` is exactly the size of a maximum matching in the subtree under _u_.\\n\\n3. **Reroot pass (BFS) to propagate “outside”‐component**  \\n   We keep for every node _u_ two values describing “the best matching in the component you get if you cut the edge to parent[u]”:  \\n   - `upDp0[u]`, `upBest[u]` = the analogues of (`dp0[u]`,`dpBest[u]`), but for the outside‐component instead of the subtree.  \\n   - `diffParent[u]` = the profit of “matching u to its parent‐side” if we chose to.\\n\\n   Then in BFS‐order we push these values down to each child _c_, by \\\"excluding\\\" _c_'s subtree contribution from the sums at _u_, and recomputing the two‐largest‐profit logic at _u_ as if _c_ weren’t there.  This gives us exactly the matching‐size of the component formed by deleting the edge \\\\((u,c)\\\\) on the side containing c.\\n\\n4. **Collect match‐sizes and pick best root**  \\n   For each node _v_, the sum of match‐sizes of its adjacent components is\\n     \\\\(\\\\sum_{u∈N(v)} mm_{u→v}\\\\)\\n   which is `sumMmAdj[v]` in the code.  If `deg[v]>=2`, the final leaf‐count is  \\n     `N - 1 - sumMmAdj[v]`  \\n   else (i.e. if `deg[v]≤1`), the root itself ends with degree 1 and _is_ a leaf, so the leaf‐count is  \\n     `N - sumMmAdj[v]`.\\n\\nWe scan all nodes _v_ and take the maximum leaf‐count.\\n\\n**Complexities**\\n\\n- Building the graph: O(N)  \\n- BFS to get parent & level‐order: O(N)  \\n- Postorder DP (one pass through `order[]`): O(N)  \\n- Reroot BFS pass: O(N)  \\n- Final scan: O(N)\\n\\nHence the overall time is **O(N)** per test, and since \\\\(\\\\sum N ≤ 3·10^5\\\\), it runs well under typical 2 s limits. Memory is O(N) for adjacency lists plus O(N) for all DP arrays.\",\n        \"refusal\": null,\n        \"role\": \"assistant\",\n        \"annotations\": [],\n        \"audio\": null,\n        \"function_call\": null,\n        \"tool_calls\": null\n      },\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"protected_material_code\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": true,\n          \"citation\": {\n            \"URL\": \"https://github.com/rrdlpl/uva/tree/4c71d5e8cc5b1daaded877466ab7cb9357704429/src%2FTrainSwapping.java\",\n            \"license\": \"NOASSERTION\"\n          }\n        },\n        \"protected_material_text\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"created\": 1753326885,\n  \"model\": \"o4-mini-2025-04-16\",\n  \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n  \"service_tier\": null,\n  \"system_fingerprint\": null,\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"completion_tokens\": 23020,\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 1004,\n    \"total_tokens\": 24024,\n    \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n      \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"reasoning_tokens\": 19008,\n      \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n    },\n    \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"cached_tokens\": 0\n    }\n  },\n  \"prompt_filter_results\": [\n    {\n      \"prompt_index\": 0,\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"jailbreak\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
