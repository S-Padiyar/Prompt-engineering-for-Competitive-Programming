First, carefully read and restate the problem in your own words to ensure full understanding. Identify the input and output formats, list the constraints, and consider any edge cases that might affect the logic. Next, determine which algorithmic pattern the problem fits best—such as greedy, binary search, two pointers, dynamic programming, or graph traversal—and briefly explain why that pattern applies. Then, plan your solution step by step, describing the key ideas, data structures, or mathematical insights you’ll use. Once your plan is clear, write a clean and fully working Java program. Use import java.util.*; and include a Main class with a main method, using Scanner or BufferedReader for input depending on the constraints. Add comments to explain important logic in the code. After coding, walk through a sample input manually to show how your solution works in practice. Finally, analyze the time and space complexity of your approach using Big-O notation, justifying your answer. Think step by step and only write code once the logic is sound and complete."

We are allowed to permute (swap) entire rows of \\\\(A\\\\) arbitrarily, and also permute (swap) entire columns arbitrarily.  We want to know whether by doing some sequence of row‐swaps and column‐swaps on \\\\(A\\\\), we can transform it exactly into \\\\(B\\\\).\\n\\nEquivalently, because every entry from \\\\(1\\\\) to \\\\(n\\\\cdot m\\\\) is distinct, each number \\\\(x\\\\) appears once in \\\\(A\\\\) at some \\\\((r_A(x),c_A(x))\\\\) and once in \\\\(B\\\\) at some \\\\((r_B(x),c_B(x))\\\\).  A row‐swap permutation \\\\(P\\\\) on the rows of \\\\(A\\\\) and a column‐swap permutation \\\\(Q\\\\) on the columns of \\\\(A\\\\) will send the entry at \\\\((r,c)\\\\) to \\\\((P(r),\\\\,Q(c))\\\\).  We need\\n\\\\[\\n  P\\\\bigl(r_A(x)\\\\bigr)=r_B(x),\\\\quad Q\\\\bigl(c_A(x)\\\\bigr)=c_B(x)\\n  \\\\quad\\\\text{for all }x.\\n\\\\]\\nSince \\\\(P\\\\) must be a well‐defined bijection on \\\\(\\\\{1,\\\\dots,n\\\\}\\\\), this forces that all entries in the same original row of \\\\(A\\\\) must end up in the same row of \\\\(B\\\\).  In particular, if two different numbers \\\\(x\\\\) and \\\\(y\\\\) both lie in row \\\\(i\\\\) of \\\\(A\\\\), then \\\\(r_B(x)\\\\) must equal \\\\(r_B(y)\\\\); otherwise there would be no single row‐permutation taking row \\\\(i\\\\) everywhere consistently.  The same reasoning applies to columns.\\n\\nConcretely, the algorithm is:\\n\\n1. Read off for each \\\\(x\\\\in[1\\\\ldots n\\\\cdot m]\\\\) its \\\\((r_A(x),c_A(x))\\\\) in \\\\(A\\\\), and \\\\((r_B(x),c_B(x))\\\\) in \\\\(B\\\\).\\n2. Try to build a row‐map array `P` of length \\\\(n\\\\):\\n   - Initialize all entries to \\\\(-1\\\\).\\n   - For each \\\\(x\\\\), let `i = rA[x]`, `j = rB[x]`.  \\n     If `P[i] == -1`, set `P[i] = j`;  \\n     else if `P[i] != j`, we have an inconsistency → answer NO.\\n3. Do the same for the column‐map array `Q` of length \\\\(m\\\\).\\n4. Finally, check that both `P` and `Q` are actually bijections (i.e.\\\\ one‐to‐one and onto).  That means each row of \\\\(A\\\\) is mapped to a distinct row of \\\\(B\\\\), and similarly for columns.  If either fails, answer NO.\\n5. Otherwise answer YES.\\n\\nThis runs in \\\\(O(n\\\\cdot m)\\\\) time per test, which is fine since the total \\\\(\\\\sum n\\\\,m\\\\le 2\\\\cdot 10^5\\\\).\\n\\nBelow is a clean Java implementation using fast I/O.\\n\\n```java\\nimport java.io.*;\\nimport java.util.*;\\n\\npublic class Main {\\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\\n        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));\\n        PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(System.out);\\n        StringTokenizer st;\\n\\n        int t = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine());\\n        while (t-- > 0) {\\n            // Read n, m\\n            st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\\n            int n = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\\n            int m = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\\n            int N = n * m;\\n\\n            // For each x from 1..N, record its position in A: (rA[x], cA[x])\\n            int[] rA = new int[N + 1], cA = new int[N + 1];\\n            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\\n                st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\\n                for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {\\n                    int x = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\\n                    rA[x] = i;\\n                    cA[x] = j;\\n                }\\n            }\\n\\n            // Record its position in B: (rB[x], cB[x])\\n            int[] rB = new int[N + 1], cB = new int[N + 1];\\n            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\\n                st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\\n                for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {\\n                    int x = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\\n                    rB[x] = i;\\n                    cB[x] = j;\\n                }\\n            }\\n\\n            // Build row‐map P: for each original row i, P[i] = target row\\n            int[] P = new int[n];\\n            Arrays.fill(P, -1);\\n            boolean ok = true;\\n            for (int x = 1; x <= N && ok; x++) {\\n                int fromRow = rA[x];\\n                int toRow = rB[x];\\n                if (P[fromRow] == -1) {\\n                    P[fromRow] = toRow;\\n                } else if (P[fromRow] != toRow) {\\n                    ok = false;  // inconsistent row‐mapping\\n                }\\n            }\\n\\n            // Build column‐map Q\\n            int[] Q = new int[m];\\n            Arrays.fill(Q, -1);\\n            for (int x = 1; x <= N && ok; x++) {\\n                int fromCol = cA[x];\\n                int toCol = cB[x];\\n                if (Q[fromCol] == -1) {\\n                    Q[fromCol] = toCol;\\n                } else if (Q[fromCol] != toCol) {\\n                    ok = false;  // inconsistent column‐mapping\\n                }\\n            }\\n\\n            // Check P is a bijection on [0..n-1], and Q is a bijection on [0..m-1]\\n            if (ok) {\\n                boolean[] usedRow = new boolean[n];\\n                for (int i = 0; i < n && ok; i++) {\\n                    if (P[i] < 0 || P[i] >= n || usedRow[P[i]]) {\\n                        ok = false;\\n                    } else {\\n                        usedRow[P[i]] = true;\\n                    }\\n                }\\n                boolean[] usedCol = new boolean[m];\\n                for (int j = 0; j < m && ok; j++) {\\n                    if (Q[j] < 0 || Q[j] >= m || usedCol[Q[j]]) {\\n                        ok = false;\\n                    } else {\\n                        usedCol[Q[j]] = true;\\n                    }\\n                }\\n            }\\n\\n            out.println(ok ? \\\"YES\\\" : \\\"NO\\\");\\n        }\\n\\n        out.flush();\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nExplanation of the steps:\\n\\n1. We scan both matrices and for each value \\\\(x\\\\) record its row/column in `A` and in `B`.\\n2. Building `P`: we want that all numbers originally in row \\\\(i\\\\) of `A` must end up in the same row of `B`.  So for each appearance of \\\\(x\\\\), we force `P[rA[x]] == rB[x]`.  If two different \\\\(x\\\\)'s in the same original row lead to two different target rows, it is impossible.\\n3. Similarly for columns and the mapping `Q`.\\n4. Finally we ensure both `P` and `Q` are bijections: every original row must map to a distinct row, and every original column to a distinct column.  If any row of `A` claims to map to the same `B`-row as another, or if something is unassigned, the answer is “NO.”\\n5. Otherwise, the decomposition \\\\(B = P\\\\cdot A \\\\cdot Q\\\\) (row‐permute by \\\\(P\\\\), column‐permute by \\\\(Q\\\\)) is valid, so we output “YES.”\\n\\nTime Complexity: We do \\\\(O(n\\\\cdot m)\\\\) work per test (reading, then two passes through the \\\\(n\\\\cdot m\\\\) values, plus checks of size \\\\(n\\\\) and \\\\(m\\\\)), giving \\\\(O(\\\\sum n\\\\,m)\\\\le 2\\\\cdot10^5\\\\).  \\nSpace Complexity: \\\\(O(n\\\\,m)\\\\) to store the four coordinate arrays.\",\n        \"refusal\": null,\n        \"role\": \"assistant\",\n        \"annotations\": [],\n        \"audio\": null,\n        \"function_call\": null,\n        \"tool_calls\": null\n      },\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"protected_material_code\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": true,\n          \"citation\": {\n            \"URL\": \"https://github.com/Ahmed-ShawkyEgy/UVA/tree/af254ea6974e5f8d13e805721895f4b5d77df564/591%20-%20Box%20of%20Bricks.java\",\n            \"license\": \"NOASSERTION\"\n          }\n        },\n        \"protected_material_text\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"created\": 1753326234,\n  \"model\": \"o4-mini-2025-04-16\",\n  \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n  \"service_tier\": null,\n  \"system_fingerprint\": null,\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"completion_tokens\": 4446,\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 1077,\n    \"total_tokens\": 5523,\n    \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n      \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"reasoning_tokens\": 2560,\n      \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n    },\n    \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"cached_tokens\": 1024\n    }\n  },\n  \"prompt_filter_results\": [\n    {\n      \"prompt_index\": 0,\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"jailbreak\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
