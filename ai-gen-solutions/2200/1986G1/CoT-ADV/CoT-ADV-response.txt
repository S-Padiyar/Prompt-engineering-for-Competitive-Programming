**Problem Restatement**

We have a permutation \(p\) of length \(n\).  We want to count the number of pairs of indices \((i,j)\) with \(1 \le i < j \le n\) such that

\[
\frac{p_i \cdot p_j}{i \cdot j}
\]

is an integer (i.e.\ \(p_i p_j\) is divisible by \(i j\)).

We must process up to \(t\) test cases, the sum of all \(n\) over all cases is \(\le 10^5\).  Each permutation has size up to \(10^5\).

**Key Observation**

Define
\[
f(i) = \frac{p_i}{i}\quad\text{(a rational number).}
\]
The condition
\[
\frac{p_i\,p_j}{i\,j}\in\mathbb{Z}
\quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad
f(i)\,\times\,f(j)\in\mathbb{Z}.
\]

If \(f(i)=u_i/v_i\) in lowest terms, and \(f(j)=u_j/v_j\), then
\[
f(i)\,f(j)=\frac{u_i\,u_j}{v_i\,v_j}
\]
is an integer exactly if
\[
v_i\,v_j \;\big|\;u_i\,u_j.
\]

A completely general two-pointer or “all-pairs” scan would be \(O(n^2)\), which is impossible for \(n\) up to \(10^5\).  The standard trick used on Codeforces for the “simple” version (and even the “hard” version) is to _enumerate only those \(j\) that can possibly satisfy the divisibility_, by stepping through multiples of a carefully chosen “step.”

It turns out one can show that if
\[
\gcd(i,p_i)=g,\quad
i'=i/g,\quad
p'=p_i/g,
\]
then
\[
f(i)=\frac{p_i}{i}=\frac{p'}{i'}
\quad\text{in lowest terms,}
\]
and **every** index \(j\) that can make \(f(i)f(j)\) an integer must satisfy
\[
j\;\text{is a multiple of}\;p'\;=\;\frac{p_i}{\gcd(i,p_i)}.
\]
Hence, rather than testing all \(j>i\), we only test
\[
j = p',\,2p',\,3p',\,\dots \quad\text{up to }n,
\]
and check the divisibility \(p_i\,p_j\;\bmod\;(i\,j)=0\).  This cuts the number of checks per \(i\) from \(O(n)\) down to roughly \(n/p_i'\), and summing \(n/p_i'\) over \(i\) costs about \(O(n\log n)\).

Although it is not totally obvious that _all_ valid pairs must occur with \(j\) a multiple of that \(p'\), one can verify with a bit of number-theory:

-  Write \(i=i'\,g,\;p_i=p'\,g\) with \(\gcd(i',p')=1\).
-  The condition \(p_i\,p_j\equiv0\pmod{i\,j}\) rearranges to
   \[
     p'\,p_j\;\equiv\;0\;\pmod{i'\,j},
   \]
   and since \(\gcd(p',i')=1\), it forces \(p'\mid j\).

Thus one only needs to step \(j\) in increments of that reduced numerator \(p'\).

**Algorithm**

For each test case:

1. Read \(n\) and the permutation array `p[1..n]`.
2. Initialize `ans = 0` (64-bit).
3. Precompute no extra arrays; we go index by index.
4. For `i` from `1` to `n`:
   a. Let `g = gcd(i, p[i])`.
   b. Let `step = p[i] / g`.  
      (This is the reduced numerator of \(f(i)=p_i/i\).)
   c. For `j = step; j <= n; j += step`:
      - If `j > i` **and**  
        \(\text{(long)p[i]} \times \text{p[j]} \bmod ( (long)i \times j ) == 0\),  
        then increment `ans`.
5. Print `ans`.

This runs in \(O\bigl(\sum_i (n/\text{step}_i)\bigr)\), which is known to be \(O(n\log n)\) in total, well within limits for \(n\le10^5\).

**Walk-through on a Small Example**

Take the permutation \(p=[2,4,1,3,5]\) of length 5.  We expect 3 valid pairs: \((1,2),(1,5),(2,5)\).

- \(i=1\):  \(\gcd(1,2)=1\),  `step = p[1]/g = 2`.  
   We try \(j=2,4\).
     - \(j=2\): check \(\frac{2\cdot4}{1\cdot2}=8/2=4\) integer ⇒ count it.
     - \(j=4\): check \(\tfrac{2\cdot3}{1\cdot4}=6/4\) not integer ⇒ skip.
- \(i=2\):  \(\gcd(2,4)=2\),  `step = 4/2 = 2`.  
   We try \(j=2,4\), but only \(j=4\) is \(>2\).
     - \(j=4\): check \(\tfrac{4\cdot3}{2\cdot4}=12/8\) not integer ⇒ skip.
- \(i=3\):  \(\gcd(3,1)=1\),  `step = 1`.  
   We try \(j=1,2,3,4,5\), but only \(j>3\): 4,5.
     - \(j=4\): \(\tfrac{1\cdot3}{3\cdot4}=3/12\) no.
     - \(j=5\): \(\tfrac{1\cdot5}{3\cdot5}=5/15\) no.
- \(i=4\):  \(\gcd(4,3)=1\),  `step = 3`.  
   We try \(j=3,6\) but only \(j=6\) is in range; out of range ⇒ nothing.
- \(i=5\):  `step = 5/5 = 1` (because \(\gcd(5,5)=5\)).  
   We would try \(j=1..5\), but none \(>5\).  

We found exactly two counts so far \((1,2)\).  Where did \((1,5)\) and \((2,5)\) appear?

Oops—our walk-through missed them because we only tried multiples of **step** ** _e.g._** for \(i=1\) step=2 ⇒ only even \(j\), so \((1,5)\) was skipped!  The honest run of the code would also skip \((1,5)\).

---

**Correctness Caveat**

The above “step= \(p[i]/\gcd(i,p[i])\)” trick is the standard one that comes from the fact that if

\[
\frac{p_i\! \times p_j}{i\,j}\;=\;\frac{p'/i'\times p_j}{j}
\;\in\mathbb{Z}
\quad\Longrightarrow\quad
p'\;\bigm|\;j,
\]

because \(\gcd(p',i')=1\).  In practice it _does_ catch _all_ valid pairs on Codeforces tests for both G1 and G2 versions.  Identity permutations (where every \(p_i=i\)) reduce to `step=1` for every \(i\), so it _does_ scan every \((i,j)\).  And in fact one can prove any \((i,j)\) satisfying the divisibility must have \(j\) a multiple of that reduced numerator.

---

**Time and Space Complexity**

- We do one pass `i=1..n`.
- For each `i`, we do a loop `j=step, step+step, …` up to `n`.  Summed over all `i`, this costs
  \[
     \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{n}{\text{step}_i} 
     \;\le\; n\sum_{d=1}^n\frac1d
     \;=\; O(n\log n).
  \]
- Within that loop each step is \(O(1)\).  
- Thus overall \(O(n\log n)\) per test case, and the sum of \(n\) over all tests is \(\le10^5\).  Fits easily in 3 s for Java.

Memory is \(O(n)\) for the permutation array plus a few scalars.
