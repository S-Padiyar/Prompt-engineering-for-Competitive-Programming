You are given two arrays a1,a2,…,an
 and b1,b2,…,bn
.

You must perform the following operation exactly once:

choose any indices l
 and r
 such that 1≤l≤r≤n
;
swap ai
 and bi
 for all i
 such that l≤i≤r
.
Find the maximum possible value of gcd(a1,a2,…,an)+gcd(b1,b2,…,bn)
 after performing the operation exactly once. Also find the number of distinct pairs (l,r)
 which achieve the maximum value.

Input
In the first line of the input, you are given a single integer t
 (1≤t≤105
), the number of test cases. Then the description of each test case follows.

In the first line of each test case, you are given a single integer n
 (1≤n≤2⋅105
), representing the number of integers in each array.

In the next line, you are given n
 integers a1,a2,…,an
 (1≤ai≤109
) — the elements of the array a
.

In the last line, you are given n
 integers b1,b2,…,bn
 (1≤bi≤109
) — the elements of the array b
.

The sum of values of n
 over all test cases does not exceed 5⋅105
.

Output
For each test case, output a line with two integers: the maximum value of gcd(a1,a2,…,an)+gcd(b1,b2,…,bn)
 after performing the operation exactly once, and the number of ways.

Note
In the first, third, and fourth test cases, there's no way to achieve a higher GCD than 1
 in any of the arrays, so the answer is 1+1=2
. Any pair (l,r)
 achieves the same result; for example, in the first test case there are 36
 such pairs.

In the last test case, you must choose l=1
, r=2
 to maximize the answer. In this case, the GCD of the first array is 5
, and the GCD of the second array is 1
, so the answer is 5+1=6
, and the number of ways is 1
.
