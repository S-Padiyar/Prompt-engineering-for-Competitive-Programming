Alice's Adventures in Cards\n\ntime limit per test2 seconds\n\nmemory limit per test256 megabytes\n\nAlice is playing cards with the Queen of Hearts, King of Hearts, and Jack of Hearts. There are n\n\n different types of cards in their card game. Alice currently has a card of type 1\n\n and needs a card of type n\n\n to escape Wonderland. The other players have one of each kind of card.\n\n\n\nIn this card game, Alice can trade cards with the three other players. Each player has different preferences for the n\n\n types of cards, which can be described by permutations∗\n\n q\n\n, k\n\n, and j\n\n for the Queen, King, and Jack, respectively.\n\n\n\nA player values card a\n\n more than card b\n\n if for their permutation p\n\n, pa>pb\n\n. Then, this player is willing to trade card b\n\n to Alice in exchange for card a\n\n. Alice's preferences are straightforward: she values card a\n\n more than card b\n\n if a>b\n\n, and she will also only trade according to these preferences.\n\n\n\nDetermine if Alice can trade up from card 1\n\n to card n\n\n subject to these preferences, and if it is possible, give a possible set of trades to do it.\n\n\n\n∗\n\nA permutation of length n\n\n is an array consisting of n\n\n distinct integers from 1\n\n to n\n\n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4]\n\n is a permutation, but [1,2,2]\n\n is not a permutation (2\n\n appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4]\n\n is also not a permutation (n=3\n\n but there is 4\n\n in the array).\n\n\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t\n\n (1≤t≤104\n\n). The description of the test cases follows.\n\n\n\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer n\n\n (2≤n≤2⋅105\n\n) — the number of card types.\n\n\n\nThe next three lines contain the preferences of the Queen, King, and Jack respectively. Each of these lines contains n\n\n integers p1,p2,…,pn\n\n (1≤pi≤n\n\n) — a permutation corresponding to the player's preferences.\n\n\n\nThe sum of n\n\n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105\n\n.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, on the first line output a single string \"YES\" or \"NO\" (without the quotes) denoting whether Alice can trade up to card n\n\n.\n\n\n\nIf the first line was \"YES\", then on the next line output k\n\n — the number of trades Alice will make. On the next k\n\n lines output space separated a character c∈{q,k,j}\n\n and integer x\n\n, denoting that Alice trades with player c\n\n to get card x\n\n. It must be the case that on the k\n\n'th line, x=n\n\n. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.\n\n\n\nYou can output this answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\", and \"YES\" will be recognized as positive responses. The same goes for the character c\n\n denoting the player in the trade (Q,K,J\n\n will all be accepted alongside their lowercase variants).\n\n\n\nExample\n\nInputCopy\n\n2\n\n3\n\n1 3 2\n\n2 1 3\n\n1 2 3\n\n4\n\n2 3 1 4\n\n1 2 3 4\n\n1 4 2 3\n\nOutputCopy\n\nYES\n\n2\n\nk 2\n\nq 3\n\nNO\n\nNote\n\nIn the first testcase, Alice can trade with the King to get card 2\n\n. She can then trade with the Queen to get card 3\n\n.\n\n\n\nIn the second testcase, even though Alice can trade with the Queen to get card 3\n\n, with the King to get card 2\n\n, and then with the Jack to get card 4\n\n, this is not a valid solution since it doesn't respect Alice's preferences. We can show that there is no way for Alice to get to card 4\n\n.\n\n---\n\nYou are a competitive programming assistant solving Codeforces problems using Java. First, carefully read and restate the problem in your own words to ensure full understanding. Identify the input and output formats, list the constraints, and consider any edge cases that might affect the logic. Next, determine which algorithmic pattern the problem fits best—such as greedy, binary search, two pointers, dynamic programming, or graph traversal—and briefly explain why that pattern applies. Then, plan your solution step by step, describing the key ideas, data structures, or mathematical insights you’ll use. Once your plan is clear, write a clean and fully working Java program. Use import java.util.*; and include a Main class with a main method, using Scanner or BufferedReader for input depending on the constraints. Add comments to explain important logic in the code. After coding, walk through a sample input manually to show how your solution works in practice. Finally, analyze the time and space complexity of your approach using Big-O notation, justifying your answer. Think step by step and only write code once the logic is sound and complete."

There are three other players—Queen, King, and Jack—each holding exactly one of every card type 1‥n initially. Each player has a strict preference (a permutation) over card types. A player \\\\(P\\\\) with preference array \\\\(p_P\\\\) will agree to trade away card \\\\(b\\\\) to Alice in exchange for card \\\\(a\\\\) *iff*\\n\\n1. Alice strictly prefers \\\\(b\\\\) over \\\\(a\\\\) (that is, \\\\(b > a\\\\)),  \\n2. Player \\\\(P\\\\) strictly prefers \\\\(a\\\\) over \\\\(b\\\\) (i.e.\\\\ \\\\(p_P[a] > p_P[b]\\\\)).\\n\\nAlice may only trade when she strictly increases her card’s type.  We need to determine whether Alice can reach card \\\\(n\\\\) by a sequence of valid trades, and if so, output one such sequence.\\n\\n**Input**\\n\\n- \\\\(t\\\\) (number of test cases),  \\n- For each test case:  \\n  - \\\\(n\\\\) (number of card types),  \\n  - Three lines each with a permutation of length \\\\(n\\\\): the Queen’s, King’s, and Jack’s preferences.\\n\\nConstraints:\\n- \\\\(1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4\\\\),\\n- Sum of all \\\\(n\\\\) over test cases \\\\(\\\\le 2\\\\times10^5\\\\),\\n- \\\\(2 \\\\le n \\\\le 2\\\\times10^5\\\\).\\n\\n**Output**\\n\\nFor each test case:\\n- Print “YES” or “NO”.\\n- If YES, on the next line print \\\\(k\\\\) = number of trades, followed by \\\\(k\\\\) lines each of the form “\\\\<player\\\\> x”, meaning “trade with \\\\<player\\\\> to get card \\\\(x\\\\)”.  The last trade must yield \\\\(x=n\\\\). Players are denoted by `q`, `k`, or `j` (case‐insensitive).\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Solution Overview**\\n\\nWe model the process as a BFS (breadth‐first search) on the space of Alice’s current card type \\\\(a\\\\in[1..n]\\\\).  From a state \\\\(a\\\\), Alice can move to a strictly larger card \\\\(b\\\\) if there exists a player \\\\(P\\\\in\\\\{\\\\mathrm{Q},\\\\mathrm{K},\\\\mathrm{J}\\\\}\\\\) such that:\\n1. \\\\(b>a\\\\), and  \\n2. \\\\(p_P[a] > p_P[b]\\\\).\\n\\nWe must avoid re‐visiting the same card \\\\(b\\\\) to prevent infinite loops.  Because \\\\(n\\\\) can be up to \\\\(2\\\\cdot10^5\\\\), we cannot explicitly list all edges.  Instead, for each player \\\\(P\\\\) we maintain a segment tree (over indices \\\\(1..n\\\\)) that stores, at position \\\\(b\\\\), the value \\\\(p_P[b]\\\\) if \\\\(b\\\\) is still “unvisited”, or \\\\(\\\\mathrm{INF}\\\\) if already taken by Alice in an earlier step.  \\n\\nIn BFS, when we pop a state \\\\(a\\\\), for each player \\\\(P\\\\) we repeatedly query:\\n\\n  — “Find the smallest index \\\\(b>a\\\\) such that \\\\(p_P[b] < p_P[a]\\\\).”\\n\\nWe implement that by a segment‐tree `findFirst` operation on the range \\\\([a+1..n]\\\\), looking for a leaf whose stored value \\\\(\\\\le p_P[a]-1\\\\).  Each successful find yields a new reachable card \\\\(b\\\\); we record the parent pointer `par[b]=a` and which player `parP[b]=P` we used, then set that tree leaf to INF (marking \\\\(b\\\\) visited) and enqueue \\\\(b\\\\).  We repeat the query on the same range until no more such \\\\(b\\\\) exist.  Once the BFS completes (or once we visit \\\\(n\\\\)), we can reconstruct the path back from \\\\(n\\\\) to \\\\(1\\\\).\\n\\nEach card type is enqueued and processed at most once per player, leading to \\\\(O(n)\\\\) tree deletions and \\\\(O(n)\\\\) “findFirst” calls, each costing \\\\(O(\\\\log n)\\\\).  Hence overall complexity \\\\(O(n\\\\log n)\\\\) per test, which is acceptable for \\\\( \\\\sum n \\\\le 2\\\\cdot10^5\\\\).\\n\\n---\\n\\n```java\\nimport java.io.*;\\nimport java.util.*;\\n\\npublic class Main {\\n    static final int INF = Integer.MAX_VALUE;\\n\\n    // Segment Tree supporting:\\n    //  - point updates: set position i to value v\\n    //  - range-min queries + \\\"find first index in [ql..qr] with value <= thresh\\\"\\n    static class SegmentTree {\\n        int n;\\n        int[] st;\\n\\n        SegmentTree(int size) {\\n            n = size;\\n            st = new int[4 * n];\\n        }\\n\\n        // Build from array arr[1..n]\\n        void build(int node, int l, int r, int[] arr) {\\n            if (l == r) {\\n                st[node] = arr[l];\\n            } else {\\n                int mid = (l + r) >>> 1;\\n                build(node << 1, l, mid, arr);\\n                build(node << 1 | 1, mid + 1, r, arr);\\n                st[node] = Math.min(st[node << 1], st[node << 1 | 1]);\\n            }\\n        }\\n\\n        // Point update: set position pos to value val\\n        void update(int node, int l, int r, int pos, int val) {\\n            if (l == r) {\\n                st[node] = val;\\n            } else {\\n                int mid = (l + r) >>> 1;\\n                if (pos <= mid) update(node << 1, l, mid, pos, val);\\n                else           update(node << 1 | 1, mid + 1, r, pos, val);\\n                st[node] = Math.min(st[node << 1], st[node << 1 | 1]);\\n            }\\n        }\\n\\n        // Find first index in [ql..qr] whose stored value <= thresh.\\n        // Returns -1 if none.\\n        int findFirst(int node, int l, int r, int ql, int qr, int thresh) {\\n            if (qr < l || r < ql || st[node] > thresh) {\\n                return -1;\\n            }\\n            if (l == r) {\\n                return l;\\n            }\\n            int mid = (l + r) >>> 1;\\n            int res = findFirst(node << 1, l, mid, ql, qr, thresh);\\n            if (res != -1) return res;\\n            return findFirst(node << 1 | 1, mid + 1, r, ql, qr, thresh);\\n        }\\n    }\\n\\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\\n        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));\\n        PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(System.out);\\n\\n        int t = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine().trim());\\n        while (t-- > 0) {\\n            int n = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine().trim());\\n\\n            // Read preferences for Q, K, J\\n            int[][] pref = new int[3][n + 1];\\n            for (int p = 0;
