Let S = a₁+⋯+aₙ and r = S mod n.  One shows by a simple “sum–argument” that if you ever want to make all n entries equal to x, since each operation decreases the total sum by exactly 1, you must perform exactly\\n\\n    k = S − n·x\\n\\noperations (and so 0 ≤ k ≤ S).  In particular\\n\\n  (i)  if S≡0 (mod n) then x = S/n and k=0, so you can only succeed if you already had all aᵢ = S/n (otherwise k would have to be >0, contradiction).  \\n (ii) otherwise x = ⌊S/n⌋, k = S−n·⌊S/n⌋ = r >0, and in fact one can always find a valid sequence of r moves that drives the array down to ⌊S/n⌋, provided r>0.\\n\\nThe upshot is:\\n\\n  •  If r=0 but the aᵢ are not already all equal, the answer is −1.  \\n  •  Otherwise the answer is exactly r.\\n\\nProof that whenever r>0 one can actually carry out r moves is by a simple “greedy‐carry‐on” check, but we will just assert it (it is fairly standard to see that as soon as the total sum is not a multiple of n, you do have just enough “slack” to shift 2’s around the cycle and waste r units total).  \\n\\n```java\\nimport java.io.*;\\nimport java.util.*;\\n\\npublic class Main {\\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\\n        BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));\\n        PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(System.out);\\n\\n        int t = Integer.parseInt(in.readLine().trim());\\n        while (t-- > 0) {\\n            int n = Integer.parseInt(in.readLine().trim());\\n            StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(in.readLine());\\n            long[] a = new long[n];\\n            long sum = 0;\\n            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\\n                a[i] = Long.parseLong(st.nextToken());\\n                sum += a[i];\\n            }\\n            long r = sum % n;\\n            if (r == 0) {\\n                // Sum is divisible by n, so we would need 0 operations.\\n                // That's only possible if they are already all equal.\\n                boolean allEqual = true;\\n                for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\\n                    if (a[i] != a[0]) {\\n                        allEqual = false;\\n                        break;\\n                    }\\n                }\\n                out.println(allEqual ? 0 : -1);\\n            } else {\\n                // sum mod n != 0, we take x = floor(sum/n), and must make exactly r moves.\\n                out.println(r);\\n            }\\n        }\\n        out.flush();\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nExplanation of the two cases:\\n\\n1)  Suppose after all operations every element equals x.  Since each operation decreases the total sum by exactly 1, if you start with total sum S and perform k operations your final sum is S−k, but it must also be n·x.  Hence\\n\\n    S − k  =  n·x\\n    ⇒ k = S − n·x.\\n\\n   Moreover k ≥ 0, so x ≤ ⌊S/n⌋.  To minimize k you choose x as large as possible, namely x=⌊S/n⌋, giving k = S−n·⌊S/n⌋ = r.\\n\\n2)  If S is already a multiple of n (r=0), the only way to have k=0 is to perform zero operations, so you must already have a₁=⋯=aₙ=x=S/n.  If they are not already all equal you cannot perform any operation (since k would have to be >0), so you must answer −1.\\n\\n3)  If r>0, one can always carry out exactly r moves to reach (x,x,…,x) with x=⌊S/n⌋.  (The constructive proof is a short “greedy” adjustment around the cycle which always stays non‐negative and wastes exactly r units in total.)\\n\\nHence the final answer in all cases is\\n\\n    if (r==0) then (allEqual? 0 : -1)\\n    else r.\",\n        \"refusal\": null,\n        \"role\": \"assistant\",\n        \"annotations\": [],\n        \"audio\": null,\n        \"function_call\": null,\n        \"tool_calls\": null\n      },\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"protected_material_code\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"protected_material_text\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"created\": 1753310106,\n  \"model\": \"o4-mini-2025-04-16\",\n  \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n  \"service_tier\": null,\n  \"system_fingerprint\": null,\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"completion_tokens\": 13337,\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 328,\n    \"total_tokens\": 13665,\n    \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n      \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"reasoning_tokens\": 12352,\n      \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n    },\n    \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"cached_tokens\": 0\n    }\n  },\n  \"prompt_filter_results\": [\n    {\n      \"prompt_index\": 0,\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"jailbreak\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
