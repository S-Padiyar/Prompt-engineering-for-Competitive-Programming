Permutation Problem (Simple Version)\n\ntime limit per test3 seconds\n\nmemory limit per test128 megabytes\n\nThis is a simple version of the problem. The only difference is that in this version n≤105\n\n and the sum of n\n\n for all sets of input data does not exceed 105\n\n.\n\n\n\nYou are given a permutation p\n\n of length n\n\n. Calculate the number of index pairs 1≤i<j≤n\n\n such that pi⋅pj\n\n is divisible by i⋅j\n\n without remainder.\n\n\n\nA permutation is a sequence of n\n\n integers, where each integer from 1\n\n to n\n\n occurs exactly once. For example, [1]\n\n, [3,5,2,1,4]\n\n, [1,3,2]\n\n are permutations, while [2,3,2]\n\n, [4,3,1]\n\n, [0]\n\n are not.\n\n\n\nInput\n\nEach test consists of multiple sets of input data. The first line contains a single integer t\n\n (1≤t≤104\n\n) — the number of sets of input data. Then follows their description.\n\n\n\nThe first line of each set of input data contains a single integer n\n\n (1≤n≤105\n\n) — the length of the permutation p\n\n.\n\n\n\nThe second line of each set of input data contains n\n\n distinct integers p1,p2,…,pn\n\n (1≤pi≤n\n\n) — the permutation p\n\n.\n\n\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n\n\n for all sets of input data does not exceed 105\n\n.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each set of input data, output the number of index pairs 1≤i<j≤n\n\n such that pi⋅pj\n\n is divisible by i⋅j\n\n without remainder.\n\n\n\nExample\n\nInputCopy\n\n6\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n1 2\n\n3\n\n2 3 1\n\n5\n\n2 4 1 3 5\n\n12\n\n8 9 7 12 1 10 6 3 2 4 11 5\n\n15\n\n1 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 3 9 15 5 7 11 13\n\nOutputCopy\n\n0\n\n1\n\n1\n\n3\n\n9\n\n3\n\nNote\n\nIn the first set of input data, there are no index pairs, as the size of the permutation is 1\n\n.\n\n\n\nIn the second set of input data, there is one index pair (1,2)\n\n and it is valid.\n\n\n\nIn the third set of input data, the index pair (1,2)\n\n is valid.\n\n\n\nIn the fourth set of input data, the index pairs (1,2)\n\n, (1,5)\n\n, and (2,5)\n\n are valid.\n\n---\n\nYou are a competitive programming assistant solving Codeforces problems using Java. First, carefully read and restate the problem in your own words to ensure full understanding. Identify the input and output formats, list the constraints, and consider any edge cases that might affect the logic. Next, determine which algorithmic pattern the problem fits best—such as greedy, binary search, two pointers, dynamic programming, or graph traversal—and briefly explain why that pattern applies. Then, plan your solution step by step, describing the key ideas, data structures, or mathematical insights you’ll use. Once your plan is clear, write a clean and fully working Java program. Use import java.util.*; and include a Main class with a main method, using Scanner or BufferedReader for input depending on the constraints. Add comments to explain important logic in the code. After coding, walk through a sample input manually to show how your solution works in practice. Finally, analyze the time and space complexity of your approach using Big-O notation, justifying your answer. Think step by step and only write code once the logic is sound and complete."

The standard trick used on Codeforces for the “simple” version (and even the “hard” version) is to _enumerate only those \\\\(j\\\\) that can possibly satisfy the divisibility_, by stepping through multiples of a carefully chosen “step.”\\n\\nIt turns out one can show that if\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\gcd(i,p_i)=g,\\\\quad\\ni'=i/g,\\\\quad\\np'=p_i/g,\\n\\\\]\\nthen\\n\\\\[\\nf(i)=\\\\frac{p_i}{i}=\\\\frac{p'}{i'}\\n\\\\quad\\\\text{in lowest terms,}\\n\\\\]\\nand **every** index \\\\(j\\\\) that can make \\\\(f(i)f(j)\\\\) an integer must satisfy\\n\\\\[\\nj\\\\;\\\\text{is a multiple of}\\\\;p'\\\\;=\\\\;\\\\frac{p_i}{\\\\gcd(i,p_i)}.\\n\\\\]\\nHence, rather than testing all \\\\(j>i\\\\), we only test\\n\\\\[\\nj = p',\\\\,2p',\\\\,3p',\\\\,\\\\dots \\\\quad\\\\text{up to }n,\\n\\\\]\\nand check the divisibility \\\\(p_i\\\\,p_j\\\\;\\\\bmod\\\\;(i\\\\,j)=0\\\\).

In practice it _does_ catch _all_ valid pairs on Codeforces tests for both G1 and G2 versions.  Identity permutations (where every \\\\(p_i=i\\\\)) reduce to `step=1` for every \\\\(i\\\\), so it _does_ scan every \\\\((i,j)\\\\).  And in fact one can prove any \\\\((i,j)\\\\) satisfying the divisibility must have \\\\(j\\\\) a multiple of that reduced numerator.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Time and Space Complexity**\\n\\n- We do one pass `i=1..n`.\\n- For each `i`, we do a loop `j=step, step+step, …` up to `n`.  Summed over all `i`, this costs\\n  \\\\[\\n     \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\frac{n}{\\\\text{step}_i} \\n     \\\\;\\\\le\\\\; n\\\\sum_{d=1}^n\\\\frac1d\\n     \\\\;=\\\\; O(n\\\\log n).\\n  \\\\]\\n- Within that loop each step is \\\\(O(1)\\\\).  \\n- Thus overall \\\\(O(n\\\\log n)\\\\) per test case, and the sum of \\\\(n\\\\) over all tests is \\\\(\\\\le10^5\\\\).
