Connect the Dots\n\ntime limit per test2 seconds\n\nmemory limit per test512 megabytes\n\nOne fine evening, Alice sat down to play the classic game \"Connect the Dots\", but with a twist.\n\n\n\nTo play the game, Alice draws a straight line and marks n\n\n points on it, indexed from 1\n\n to n\n\n. Initially, there are no arcs between the points, so they are all disjoint. After that, Alice performs m\n\n operations of the following type:\n\n\n\nShe picks three integers ai\n\n, di\n\n (1≤di≤10\n\n), and ki\n\n.\n\nShe selects points ai,ai+di,ai+2di,ai+3di,…,ai+ki⋅di\n\n and connects each pair of these points with arcs.\n\nAfter performing all m\n\n operations, she wants to know the number of connected components†\n\n these points form. Please help her find this number.\n\n\n\n†\n\n Two points are said to be in one connected component if there is a path between them via several (possibly zero) arcs and other points.\n\n\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t\n\n (1≤t≤105\n\n). The description of the test cases follows.\n\n\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers n\n\n and m\n\n (1≤n≤2⋅105\n\n, 1≤m≤2⋅105\n\n).\n\n\n\nThe i\n\n-th of the following m\n\n lines contains three integers ai\n\n, di\n\n, and ki\n\n (1≤ai≤ai+ki⋅di≤n\n\n, 1≤di≤10\n\n, 0≤ki≤n\n\n).\n\n\n\nIt is guaranteed that both the sum of n\n\n and the sum of m\n\n over all test cases do not exceed 2⋅105\n\n.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output the number of connected components.\n\n\n\nExample\n\nInputCopy\n\n3\n\n10 2\n\n1 2 4\n\n2 2 4\n\n100 1\n\n19 2 4\n\n100 3\n\n1 2 5\n\n7 2 6\n\n17 2 31\n\nOutputCopy\n\n2\n\n96\n\n61\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, there are n=10\n\n points. The first operation joins the points 1\n\n, 3\n\n, 5\n\n, 7\n\n, and 9\n\n. The second operation joins the points 2\n\n, 4\n\n, 6\n\n, 8\n\n, and 10\n\n. There are thus two connected components: {1,3,5,7,9}\n\n and {2,4,6,8,10}\n\n.\n\n\n\nIn the second test case, there are n=100\n\n points. The only operation joins the points 19\n\n, 21\n\n, 23\n\n, 25\n\n, and 27\n\n. Now all of them form a single connected component of size 5\n\n. The other 95\n\n points form single-point connected components. Thus, the answer is 1+95=96\n\n.\n\n\n\nIn the third test case, there are n=100\n\n points. After the operations, all odd points from 1\n\n to 79\n\n will be in one connected component of size 40\n\n. The other 60\n\n points form single-point connected components. Thus, the answer is 1+60=61\n\n.\n\n---\n\nLet's think step-by-step so we don't make mistakes. Use Java. Avoid syntax errors or infinite loops."

We sort by left endpoint, then do a standard “merge overlapping intervals” sweep.  We end up with disjoint intervals \\\\([L,R]\\\\).\\n\\n5.  **Making the necessary unions**: to connect all points in \\\\([L,R]\\\\), we only need to union adjacent pairs \\\\((t,t+1)\\\\) for \\\\(t=L,\\\\dots,R-1\\\\).  Crucially, this guarantees we do each adjacent‐pair union at most once per residue‐class.  Since each residue‐class has length \\\\(\\\\lfloor n/d\\\\rfloor\\\\), there are at most \\\\(\\\\lfloor n/d\\\\rfloor-1\\\\) distinct adjacent pairs—and summing \\\\(d=1\\\\) to \\\\(10\\\\) gives \\\\(O(n)\\\\) total unions.\\n\\n6.  **Count components**: after processing all \\\\(d\\\\) and all residues, we simply count how many elements are their own parent in the DSU.\\n\\nThis runs in \\\\(O((n+m)\\\\log m + n\\\\alpha(n))\\\\), which is efficient for total \\\\(n,m\\\\) up to \\\\(2\\\\cdot10^5\\\\).\",\n        \"refusal\": null,\n        \"role\": \"assistant\",\n        \"annotations\": [],\n        \"audio\": null,\n        \"function_call\": null,\n        \"tool_calls\": null\n      },\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"protected_material_code\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": true,\n          \"citation\": {\n            \"URL\": \"https://github.com/huyaye/Algorithm/tree/64f917a774ec5422654fffd94c829765cd50280a/src%2Falgorithms%2FDisjointSet.java\",\n            \"license\": \"NOASSERTION\"\n          }\n        },\n        \"protected_material_text\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"created\": 1753309645,\n  \"model\": \"o4-mini-2025-04-16\",\n  \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n  \"service_tier\": null,\n  \"system_fingerprint\": null,\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"completion_tokens\": 7527,\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 735,\n    \"total_tokens\": 8262,\n    \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n      \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"reasoning_tokens\": 4672,\n      \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n    },\n    \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"cached_tokens\": 0\n    }\n  },\n  \"prompt_filter_results\": [\n    {\n      \"prompt_index\": 0,\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"jailbreak\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
