Cards Partition\n\ntime limit per test2 seconds\n\nmemory limit per test256 megabytes\n\nDJ Genki vs Gram - Einherjar Joker\n\n⠀\n\nYou have some cards. An integer between 1\n\n and n\n\n is written on each card: specifically, for each i\n\n from 1\n\n to n\n\n, you have ai\n\n cards which have the number i\n\n written on them.\n\n\n\nThere is also a shop which contains unlimited cards of each type. You have k\n\n coins, so you can buy at most k\n\n new cards in total, and the cards you buy can contain any integer between 1\n\n and n\n\n, inclusive.\n\n\n\nAfter buying the new cards, you must partition all your cards into decks, according to the following rules:\n\n\n\nall the decks must have the same size;\n\nthere are no pairs of cards with the same value in the same deck.\n\nFind the maximum possible size of a deck after buying cards and partitioning them optimally.\n\n\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t\n\n (1≤t≤104\n\n). The description of the test cases follows.\n\n\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers n\n\n, k\n\n (1≤n≤2⋅105\n\n, 0≤k≤1016\n\n) — the number of distinct types of cards and the number of coins.\n\n\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n\n\n integers a1,a2,…,an\n\n (0≤ai≤1010\n\n, ∑ai≥1\n\n) — the number of cards of type i\n\n you have at the beginning, for each 1≤i≤n\n\n.\n\n\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n\n\n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105\n\n.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single integer: the maximum possible size of a deck if you operate optimally.\n\n\n\nExample\n\nInputCopy\n\n9\n\n3 1\n\n3 2 2\n\n5 4\n\n2 6 1 2 4\n\n2 100\n\n1410065408 10000000000\n\n10 8\n\n7 4 6 6 9 3 10 2 8 7\n\n2 12\n\n2 2\n\n2 70\n\n0 1\n\n1 0\n\n1\n\n3 0\n\n2 1 2\n\n3 1\n\n0 3 3\n\nOutputCopy\n\n2\n\n3\n\n1\n\n7\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, you can buy one card with the number 1\n\n, and your cards become [1,1,1,1,2,2,3,3]\n\n. You can partition them into the decks [1,2],[1,2],[1,3],[1,3]\n\n: they all have size 2\n\n, and they all contain distinct values. You can show that you cannot get a partition with decks of size greater than 2\n\n, so the answer is 2\n\n.\n\n\n\nIn the second test case, you can buy two cards with the number 1\n\n and one card with the number 3\n\n, and your cards become [1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5,5]\n\n, which can be partitioned into [1,2,3],[1,2,4],[1,2,5],[1,2,5],[2,3,5],[2,4,5]\n\n. You can show that you cannot get a partition with decks of size greater than 3\n\n, so the answer is 3\n\n.\n\n---\n\nYou are a competitive programming assistant solving Codeforces problems using Java. First, carefully read and restate the problem in your own words to ensure full understanding. Identify the input and output formats, list the constraints, and consider any edge cases that might affect the logic. Next, determine which algorithmic pattern the problem fits best—such as greedy, binary search, two pointers, dynamic programming, or graph traversal—and briefly explain why that pattern applies. Then, plan your solution step by step, describing the key ideas, data structures, or mathematical insights you’ll use. Once your plan is clear, write a clean and fully working Java program. Use import java.util.*; and include a Main class with a main method, using Scanner or BufferedReader for input depending on the constraints. Add comments to explain important logic in the code. After coding, walk through a sample input manually to show how your solution works in practice. Finally, analyze the time and space complexity of your approach using Big-O notation, justifying your answer. Think step by step and only write code once the logic is sound and complete."

We may buy up to *k* extra cards (each purchase costs one coin), choosing any types we like.  After buying, we must split *all* the cards into decks so that:\\n\\n- All decks have the same size *s*.\\n- Within one deck, no two cards share the same type.\\n\\nWe want to maximize *s*.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Key Observations.**\\n\\n1.  Let *S* = ∑₍ᵢ₌₁…ₙ₎ *a₍ᵢ₎* be the total number of cards we start with, and let *M* = max₍ᵢ₎ *a₍ᵢ₎*.  \\n2.  Suppose finally we have bought *x₍ᵢ₎* cards of type *i*, for a total of ∑ *x₍ᵢ₎* ≤ *k*.  Then our new counts are *b₍ᵢ₎* = *a₍ᵢ₎* + *x₍ᵢ₎*.  \\n3.  If we form *m* decks each of size *s*, then  \\n   - Total cards used: ∑ *b₍ᵢ₎* = *m·s*.  \\n   - Because within each deck a type can appear at most once, over *m* decks each type *i* can be used at most *m* times, so *b₍ᵢ₎* ≤ *m* must hold for all *i*.  \\n   - Conversely, any choice of *b₍ᵢ₎* ∈ [*a₍ᵢ₎*, *m*] summing to *m·s* can be distributed to decks (a standard “fill one copy of type *i* in *b₍ᵢ₎* distinct decks” argument).  \\n\\n4.  Hence the constraints reduce to finding integers *s* (deck size) and *m* (number of decks) so that:\\n   - ∑ *a₍ᵢ₎* ≤ *m·s* ≤ ∑ *a₍ᵢ₎* + *k*   (we buy exactly *m·s* – ∑ *a₍ᵢ₎* ≤ *k* cards),\\n   - *m* ≥ max₍ᵢ₎ *a₍ᵢ₎* = *M*  (so that we never need to cap a type below its original count),\\n   - *s* ≤ *n*  (deck size cannot exceed the number of distinct types).\\n\\n   Let *S* = ∑ *a₍ᵢ₎*.  Then these become:\\n   - *m·s* ≥ *S*  ⇒  *m* ≥ ⌈*S* / *s*⌉,  \\n   - *m·s* ≤ *S* + *k*  ⇒  *m* ≤ ⌊(*S* + *k*) / *s*⌋,  \\n   - also *m* ≥ *M*.  \\n\\n   Therefore for a fixed *s*, feasibility is:\\n     max( *M*, ⌈*S* / *s*⌉ )  ≤  ⌊(*S*+*k*) / *s*⌋.\\n\\n5.  We want the maximum *s* ∈ [1…*n*] satisfying that.  Although one might hope for a monotonic (binary‐searchable) structure, in fact the condition can be non‐monotonic in *s*.  However, the sum of all *n* across test cases is ≤2·10⁵, so we can afford an *O(n)* check per test.  \\n\\n---\\n\\n**Solution Outline.**\\n\\nFor each test:\\n\\n1. Read *n*, *k*, and the array *a₁…aₙ*.  \\n2. Compute  \\n   - *S* = ∑ *aᵢ*  (as `long`),  \\n   - *M* = max₍ᵢ₎ *aᵢ*.  \\n3. Initialize `best = 1` (we can always make deck‐size 1).  \\n4. For *s* from 1 to *n*:\\n   - Compute  \\n     L = ceil(S/s) = (S + s – 1) / s  \\n     R = floor((S + k) / s)  \\n   - Let `need = Math.max(M, L);`\\n   - If `need <= R` then `best = s`.\\n5. Print `best`.\\n\\nThis runs in *O(n)* per test, total *O(∑n) = O(2·10⁵)*, and uses only constant extra memory (besides the input array).\\n\\n---\\n\\n```java\\nimport java.io.BufferedReader;\\nimport java.io.InputStreamReader;\\nimport java.io.IOException;\\nimport java.util.StringTokenizer;\\n\\npublic class Main {\\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\\n        // Fast input\\n        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));\\n        StringTokenizer st;\\n        \\n        int t = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine().trim());\\n        while (t-- > 0) {\\n            // Read n, k\\n            st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\\n            int n = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\\n            long k = Long.parseLong(st.nextToken());\\n            \\n            // Read array a[]\\n            long S = 0;       // sum of a[i]\\n            long M = 0;       // max of a[i]\\n            st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\\n            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\\n                long ai = Long.parseLong(st.nextToken());\\n                S += ai;\\n                if (ai > M) {\\n                    M = ai;\\n                }\\n            }\\n            \\n            int best = 1;  // deck size at least 1 is always possible\\n            // Try all s = 1..n\\n            for (int s = 1; s <= n; s++) {\\n                // Minimal number of decks needed so that m*s >= S\\n                long L = (S + s - 1) / s;            \\n                // Maximal number of decks we can afford buying at most k cards\\n                long R = (S + k) / s;               \\n                long need = Math.max(M, L);\\n                // Feasible if there's some integer m in [need..R]\\n                if (need <= R) {\\n                    best = s;\\n                }\\n            }\\n            \\n            System.out.println(best);\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Worked Example.**  \\nTake the sample  \\n```\\nn = 3, k = 1, a = [3, 2, 2].\\n```\\nHere *S* = 7, *M* = 3.\\n\\nWe test s = 1…3:\\n\\n- s = 1:  \\n  L = ceil(7/1)=7,   R = floor((7+1)/1)=8,  need = max(3,7)=7 ≤ 8 ⇒ OK. best=1  \\n- s = 2:  \\n  L = ceil(7/2)=4,   R = floor(8/2)=4,    need = max(3,4)=4 ≤ 4 ⇒ OK. best=2  \\n- s = 3:  \\n  L = ceil(7/3)=3,   R = floor(8/3)=2,    need = max(3,3)=3 > 2 ⇒ NO  \\n\\nAnswer = 2, which matches the sample.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Complexity.**  \\nFor each test case we do an *O(n)* loop (s from 1 to *n*), and each iteration is *O(1)* work.
