If `v` is a leaf, there is no child‐constraint to satisfy, so\\n   - `dp0[v] = 0` (we leave `a'[v] = a[v]` with no cost),\\n   - `inc[v] = 1` (to bump `a'[v]` by one costs exactly one operation on the leaf).\\n\\n2. Otherwise, let the children be `u₁,…,uₖ`.  We have their `(dp0,inc)` computed already.  \\n   We accumulate\\n   - `sumDP0 = ∑ dp0[uᵢ]`\\n   - `sumA = ∑ a[uᵢ]`\\n   - `best = minᵢ inc[uᵢ]`  \\n\\n   In order to keep `a'[v] = a[v]` we must have  \\n      sum of final children ≥ a[v].  \\n   Initially the children contribute only `sumA`, so if `sumA < a[v]` we have a deficit  \\n      `D = a[v] − sumA`.  \\n   Each extra unit in that sum costs at least `best` (since we can always spend one unit in the cheapest child's subtree repeatedly), so it costs `D * best`.  \\n   Hence  \\n      `dp0[v] = sumDP0 + D * best`.  \\n\\n3. Finally, if we did want to raise `a'[v]` from `a[v]` to `a[v]+1`, we would have to pay one extra operation at `v` itself.  Hence the marginal cost  \\n      `inc[v] = best + 1`.\\n\\nAfter the DFS, the answer for the whole tree is `dp0[1]`.  That runs in linear time per test and handles up to n = 5000 comfortably.\",\n        \"refusal\": null,\n        \"role\": \"assistant\",\n        \"annotations\": [],\n        \"audio\": null,\n        \"function_call\": null,\n        \"tool_calls\": null\n      },\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"protected_material_code\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"protected_material_text\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"created\": 1753309860,\n  \"model\": \"o4-mini-2025-04-16\",\n  \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n  \"service_tier\": null,\n  \"system_fingerprint\": null,\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"completion_tokens\": 21866,\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 583,\n    \"total_tokens\": 22449,\n    \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n      \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"reasoning_tokens\": 20416,\n      \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n    },\n    \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"cached_tokens\": 0\n    }\n  },\n  \"prompt_filter_results\": [\n    {\n      \"prompt_index\": 0,\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"jailbreak\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
