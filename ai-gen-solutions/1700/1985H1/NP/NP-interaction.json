Maximize the Largest Component (Easy Version)\n\ntime limit per test2 seconds\n\nmemory limit per test512 megabytes\n\nEasy and hard versions are actually different problems, so read statements of both problems completely and carefully. The only difference between the two versions is the operation.\n\n\n\nAlex has a grid with n\n\n rows and m\n\n columns consisting of '.' and '#' characters. A set of '#' cells forms a connected component if from any cell in this set, it is possible to reach any other cell in this set by only moving to another cell in the set that shares a common side. The size of a connected component is the number of cells in the set.\n\n\n\nIn one operation, Alex selects any row r\n\n (1≤r≤n\n\n) or any column c\n\n (1≤c≤m\n\n), then sets every cell in row r\n\n or column c\n\n to be '#'. Help Alex find the maximum possible size of the largest connected component of '#' cells that he can achieve after performing the operation at most once.\n\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer t\n\n (1≤t≤104\n\n) — the number of test cases.\n\n\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers n\n\n and m\n\n (1≤n⋅m≤106\n\n) — the number of rows and columns of the grid.\n\n\n\nThe next n\n\n lines each contain m\n\n characters.

A connected component of `#`‐cells is the usual 4-connected component (up/down/left/right).  We may do **at most one** operation: pick a row or a column and paint **every** cell in that row/column `#`.  We want to maximize the size of the largest `#`‐component after at most one such operation.\\n\\nLet us denote\\n\\n- \\\\(\\\\mathrm{origMax}\\\\) = the size of the largest component in the original grid (with zero operations).\\n- \\\\(\\\\mathrm{bestPaint}\\\\) = the best we can do by painting exactly one row or column.\\n\\nIn the end the answer is\\n\\\\[\\n  \\\\max(\\\\mathrm{origMax}, \\\\mathrm{bestPaint}).\\n\\\\]\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Step 1.  Precompute the original components**\\n\\nWe first run a single BFS/DFS over the grid to label each `#`‐component with a component ID (1,2,…).  We also record the size of each component.  This takes \\\\(O(nm)\\\\) time in total.\\n\\n- We flatten the grid into a 1D array of length \\\\(n\\\\times m\\\\).  \\n- We keep an integer array `comp[i]` storing the component‐ID of cell \\\\(i\\\\), or 0 if it is `.`.\\n- We keep an array `compSize[id]` storing the size of component `id`.\\n- As we BFS each new unlabeled `#` cell, we assign it a new `id`, flood‐fill all cells of that component, and count how many there are.\\n\\nLet \\\\(\\\\mathrm{origMax}\\\\) be the maximum over all `compSize[id]`.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Step 2.  Simulate “paint a row”**\\n\\nIf we paint row \\\\(r\\\\), then:\\n\\n1. We add \\\\(m\\\\) new `#` cells all in row \\\\(r\\\\).  \\n2. Each of these new cells may attach to existing components immediately above or below it,\\n   i.e.\\\\ if cell \\\\((r-1,j)\\\\) or \\\\((r+1,j)\\\\) was already `#`, we will absorb that entire component.\\n\\nAll the newly painted row is itself one big connected band.  So the size of the *new* big component\\nformed by the painted row is\\n\\\\[\\n   m \\\\;+\\\\; \\\\sum_{\\\\substack{\\\\text{distinct old‐component}\\\\\\\\\\n                         \\\\text{IDs adjacent above/below}}} \\n         \\\\bigl(\\\\text{that component’s size}\\\\bigr).\\n\\\\]\\n\\nWe can scan columns \\\\(j=0\\\\ldots m-1\\\\), look at the original cell \\\\((r-1,j)\\\\) and \\\\((r+1,j)\\\\) (if in\\nbounds), pick out their component IDs, and sum up each (once) via a “last‐seen” stamp array\\nto avoid double‐counting.  That costs \\\\(O(m)\\\\) work for each row, and there are \\\\(n\\\\) rows,\\nso \\\\(O(nm)\\\\) total for “paint every row.”\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Step 3.  Simulate “paint a column”**\\n\\nSimilarly, painting column \\\\(c\\\\) adds \\\\(n\\\\) new `#` cells in that column.  They may attach to the\\noriginal components to the left or right (cells \\\\((i,c-1)\\\\), \\\\((i,c+1)\\\\)).  We do exactly the\\nsame “stamp” trick to sum each adjacent component’s size once.  Each column takes \\\\(O(n)\\\\),\\nand there are \\\\(m\\\\) columns, so \\\\(O(nm)\\\\) again.\\n\\n---\\n\\nOverall time per test is \\\\(O(nm)\\\\).  Since the sum of \\\\(nm\\\\) over all test cases is \\\\(\\\\le10^6\\\\),\\nthis runs in a couple of million operations in total, well within the 2 s limit.\\n\\n---\\n\\n```java\\nimport java.io.*;\\nimport java.util.*;\\n\\npublic class Main {\\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\\n        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));\\n        StringBuilder   sb = new StringBuilder();\\n        int t = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine().trim());\\n        \\n        // Directions for 4-connected BFS\\n        final int[] d4i = {-1, 1, 0, 0};\\n        final int[] d4j = { 0, 0,-1, 1};\\n        \\n        while (t-- > 0) {\\n            StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\\n            int n = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\\n            int m = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\\n            char[][] grid = new char[n][];\\n            for (int i = 0;

We also record the size of each component.\\n\\n2. **Painting a row**  \\n   - When you paint row \\\\(r\\\\), you immediately get \\\\(m\\\\) new `#` cells along that row.  \\n   - Each new cell \\\\((r,j)\\\\) may connect to a pre‐existing component directly above \\\\((r-1,j)\\\\) or directly below \\\\((r+1,j)\\\\).  \\n   - Since the entire painted row is one long connected segment, *all* such adjacent components become part of *one merged component*.  \\n   - We must add *each* adjacent old component’s size **once**.  To avoid double‐counting, we use a `lastUsed[compID]` array with an incrementing `timestamp` for each row.\\n\\n3. **Painting a column**  \\n   - Analoguously, painting column \\\\(c\\\\) gives \\\\(n\\\\) new cells \\\\((i,c)\\\\).  \\n   - They can attach to components to the left \\\\((i,c-1)\\\\) or right \\\\((i,c+1)\\\\).  \\n   - Again we sum each touched component’s size once via the same stamp technique.\\n\\n4. **Answer**  \\n   The best one‐row paint or one‐column paint is `bestPaint`.  But we could also choose to do *no* operation if the grid already has a large component.  Hence we take\\n   \\\\[\\n     \\\\max(\\\\text{origMax}, \\\\text{bestPaint}) \\n   \\\\]\\n   as the final answer.\\n\\nThis runs in \\\\(O(nm)\\\\) per test and easily handles up to a total of \\\\(10^6\\\\) cells over all tests within the 2 second limit.\",\n        \"refusal\": null,\n        \"role\": \"assistant\",\n        \"annotations\": [],\n        \"audio\": null,\n        \"function_call\": null,\n        \"tool_calls\": null\n      },\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"protected_material_code\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": true,\n          \"citation\": {\n            \"URL\": \"https://github.com/kyu9/MyBook/tree/3ae624f937fa65e7b5311a2a932dcd9d766a71fa/baekjoon%2Fsorting%2F2108.md\",\n            \"license\": \"NOASSERTION\"\n          }\n        },\n        \"protected_material_text\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"created\": 1753309356,\n  \"model\": \"o4-mini-2025-04-16\",\n  \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n  \"service_tier\": null,\n  \"system_fingerprint\": null,\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"completion_tokens\": 6323,\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 612,\n    \"total_tokens\": 6935,\n    \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n      \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"reasoning_tokens\": 3968,\n      \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n    },\n    \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"cached_tokens\": 0\n    }\n  },\n  \"prompt_filter_results\": [\n    {\n      \"prompt_index\": 0,\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"jailbreak\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
