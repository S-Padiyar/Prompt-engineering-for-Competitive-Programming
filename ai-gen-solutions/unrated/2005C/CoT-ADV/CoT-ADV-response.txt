**Problem Restatement**

We have \(n\) strings (each of length \(m\)), and we may choose any subset of them in their original order, concatenating them into a single long string \(S\). We look for occurrences of the word “narek” as a subsequence in \(S\), greedily from left to right, and each complete match of “narek” scores \(+5\). Any character in \(S\) that is one of \(\{n,a,r,e,k\}\) but is *not* used in one of these full matches is scored by the opponent ChatGPT at \(+1\).  We want to maximize

\[
\text{(our score)} - \text{(ChatGPT’s score)}.
\]

Let:
- \(x\) = number of complete “narek” subsequences we find,
- \(t\) = total number of letters in \(S\) that are in \(\{n,a,r,e,k\}\).

We can show (and carefully track partial attempts) that
\[
\text{our score} = 5x,\quad
\text{ChatGPT’s score} = t-5x,
\]
so the net value is
\[
5x \;-\;(t - 5x)\;=\;10x \;-\; t.
\]

We need to pick a subsequence of the \(n\) blocks (strings) to maximize
\[
10\,(\#\,\text{of “narek” we form}) \;-\; (\#\,\text{of letters in }\{n,a,r,e,k\}\text{ in the chosen blocks}).
\]

**Algorithmic Pattern**

This is a classic *DP on a sequence of blocks* with a small finite automaton (the 5‐state automaton for matching “narek”).  We keep a DP state
\[
\mathrm{dp}[k] = \max\bigl(10x - t\bigr)
\]
for having matched \(k\) letters of the current (incomplete) “narek” pattern (so \(k=0\) means we’re looking next for 'n', \(k=1\) means we've just matched 'n' and look next for 'a', …, up to \(k=4\) looking for final 'k').

Transitioning over a block \(s\):

1. We compute \(t_{\mathrm{add}} =\) the count of letters in \(s\) that belong to \(\{n,a,r,e,k\}\).
2. For each incoming state \(k_{\mathrm{in}}\in\{0,\dots,4\}\), we simulate greedily scanning \(s\):
   - We start with automaton state \(k=k_{\mathrm{in}}\), 
   - Each time we see the needed pattern character `pat[k]`, we do `k++`; once `k` reaches 5, we found one “narek,” increase `x_add` by 1 and reset `k=0`.  
   - At the end we record how many full matches `x_add` we got in this block and the final automaton state `k_out`.
3. Taking this block from state \(k_{\mathrm{in}}\) yields  
   \[
     \Delta(\mathrm{dp}) = 10\cdot x_{\mathrm{add}} - t_{\mathrm{add}},
     \quad
     k_{\mathrm{out}}.
   \]
4. We do the usual “take or skip” DP update, keeping the best over both.

Since each block is at most length \(m\), and we have 5 states, each block costs \(O(5m)\) to precompute its transitions.  The DP over \(n\) blocks is \(O(n\cdot5)\).  Overall across all test cases, \(\sum n m \le 10^6\), so this is efficient.

**Explanation of Key Steps**

1. **State Definition**  
   We keep an array `dp[0..4]`.  `dp[k]` stores the maximum of  
   \[
     10\cdot (\#\text{complete “narek”}) \;-\; (\#\text{pattern letters used})
   \]
   so far, *given that* we have already matched \(k\) letters of the next “narek” and are expecting `pat[k]` next.

2. **Transitions over One Block**  
   - We count \(t_{\mathrm{add}}\), the number of ‘n’,’a’,’r’,’e’,’k’ in that block, because each contributes \(-1\) to the net score if not used in a complete pattern.
   - For each incoming state \(k_{\mathrm{in}}\), we simulate a small automaton over the block string: whenever we see `pat[k]`, we advance `k`.  Hitting `k==5` means one full “narek” is found (so we'll add \(+10\) to our net score, since \(10x\) appears in the formula).  Then reset `k=0` and continue scanning.
   - That gives us two integers for each `k_in`:  
     - `xAdd[k_in]` = how many full patterns we formed inside this block,  
     - `outState[k_in]` = the final automaton state (how many letters of the next pattern are already matched).
   - Taking the block moves `dp[k_in] → dp'[outState[k_in]]` with an increment of `10*xAdd[k_in] - t_add`.

3. **"Take or Skip"**  
   We do both in one sweep by starting `newDp = dp` (the “skip” case) and then attempting the “take” transitions, taking the maximum.

4. **Final Answer**  
   After processing all blocks, the best net score is \(\max_{k} dp[k]\).  We also compare with 0, since we can always choose no strings.

**Complexity Analysis**

- Preprocessing each block of length \(m\) costs \(O(m)\) to count pattern letters, and \(O(5m)\) to simulate the 5 entry states → \(O(5m)\).
- There are \(n\) blocks, and \(\sum n m \le 10^6\), so total work \(\displaystyle O\bigl(\sum 5m\bigr)=O(5\cdot10^6)\) over all tests.  
- The DP over \(n\) blocks is another \(O(5n)\), which is negligible in comparison.
- Overall time is \(O(\sum n m)\), comfortably within the limits.

This solves the problem in under 2 seconds and within the 256 MB memory limit.
