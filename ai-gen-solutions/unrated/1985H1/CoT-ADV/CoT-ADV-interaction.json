Maximize the Largest Component (Easy Version)\n\ntime limit per test2 seconds\n\nmemory limit per test512 megabytes\n\nEasy and hard versions are actually different problems, so read statements of both problems completely and carefully. The only difference between the two versions is the operation.\n\n\n\nAlex has a grid with n\n\n rows and m\n\n columns consisting of '.' and '#' characters. A set of '#' cells forms a connected component if from any cell in this set, it is possible to reach any other cell in this set by only moving to another cell in the set that shares a common side.

First, carefully read and restate the problem in your own words to ensure full understanding. Identify the input and output formats, list the constraints, and consider any edge cases that might affect the logic. Next, determine which algorithmic pattern the problem fits best—such as greedy, binary search, two pointers, dynamic programming, or graph traversal—and briefly explain why that pattern applies. Then, plan your solution step by step, describing the key ideas, data structures, or mathematical insights you’ll use. Once your plan is clear, write a clean and fully working Java program. Use import java.util.*; and include a Main class with a main method, using Scanner or BufferedReader for input depending on the constraints. Add comments to explain important logic in the code. After coding, walk through a sample input manually to show how your solution works in practice. Finally, analyze the time and space complexity of your approach using Big-O notation, justifying your answer. Think step by step and only write code once the logic is sound and complete."

A connected component of ‘#’-cells is defined by 4-directional adjacency.  We may perform *at most one* operation: choose a single row or column and turn *every* cell in that row or column into ‘#’.  After at most one such operation, what is the maximum possible size of the largest connected component of ‘#’?\\n\\nWe must process up to \\\\(t\\\\) test cases, with the total number of cells across all test cases at most \\\\(10^6\\\\).\\n\\n**Key Observation and Algorithm**\\n\\n1. **Label Original Components**  \\n   First, we flood–fill (BFS/DFS) the original grid to label each connected component of ‘#’ and record its size.  Let there be \\\\(C\\\\) original components, indexed \\\\(1\\\\ldots C\\\\), and let `compSize[id]` be the size of component `id`.  Also let\\n   - `ans0 =` the size of the largest original component (before any operation).\\n   - `rowCount[r] =` how many `'#'` were originally in row \\\\(r\\\\).\\n   - `colCount[c] =` how many `'#'` were originally in column \\\\(c\\\\).\\n\\n2. **Effect of Filling a Row**  \\n   Suppose we fill row \\\\(r\\\\).  All \\\\(m\\\\) cells in row \\\\(r\\\\) become `'#'`.  They form a contiguous horizontal strip of length \\\\(m\\\\).  Any original component that touches (i.e.\\\\ is 4-adjacent to) at least one cell in that new strip will be merged into it.  Adjacent cells can come from:\\n   - the newly filled row cells themselves if they were originally `'#'`,\\n   - their cells immediately above (row \\\\(r-1\\\\)), or\\n   - their cells immediately below (row \\\\(r+1\\\\)).\\n\\n   Let `adjComps` be the set of distinct original component IDs that neighbor row \\\\(r\\\\).  Then the merged component will have\\n   - **\\\\(m\\\\)** new cells from the filled row, plus\\n   - **all** cells of each component in `adjComps` *except* we must not double-count those cells of those components that were originally in row \\\\(r\\\\) itself (since those are already counted in the \\\\(m\\\\) cells).\\n\\n   If we sum the full size of each component in `adjComps` we over-count exactly `rowCount[r]` cells (the original `'#'` in row \\\\(r\\\\)).  Hence the size after filling row \\\\(r\\\\) is\\n   \\\\[\\n     S_{\\\\text{row }r}\\n       = m \\n       + \\\\sum_{id\\\\in \\\\text{adjComps}} \\\\text{compSize}[id]\\n       \\\\;-\\\\; \\\\text{rowCount}[r].\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n3. **Effect of Filling a Column**  \\n   Analogously, filling column \\\\(c\\\\) adds \\\\(n\\\\) new cells, merges all original components that touch column \\\\(c\\\\) (from left, right, or on the column itself), and we subtract `colCount[c]` to avoid double-counting those originally in column \\\\(c\\\\).  \\n   \\\\[\\n     S_{\\\\text{col }c}\\n       = n\\n       + \\\\sum_{id\\\\in \\\\text{adjComps}}\\n       \\\\text{compSize}[id]\\n       \\\\;-\\\\; \\\\text{colCount}[c].\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n4. **Implementation Details**\\n   - Flood–fill to find components in \\\\(O(nm)\\\\).  \\n   - For each row \\\\(r\\\\), in \\\\(O(m)\\\\) time we gather all adjacent component IDs (we check the 3 rows \\\\(r-1,r,r+1\\\\) at each column \\\\(j\\\\)), deduplicate them via a small per-row boolean array, sum their sizes, compute \\\\(S_{\\\\text{row }r}\\\\).  \\n   - Likewise for each column in \\\\(O(n)\\\\) time.  \\n   - Take the maximum among:\\n     - No operation: `ans0`\\n     - Best row-fill: \\\\(\\\\max_r S_{\\\\text{row }r}\\\\)\\n     - Best col-fill: \\\\(\\\\max_c S_{\\\\text{col }c}\\\\)\\n\\nOverall time per test is \\\\(O(nm + n\\\\cdot m + m\\\\cdot n)\\\\)=\\\\(O(nm)\\\\).  Since total cells over all tests \\\\(\\\\le10^6\\\\), this runs easily in time.\\n\\n---\\n\\n```java\\nimport java.io.*;\\nimport java.util.*;\\n\\npublic class Main {\\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\\n        // Fast I/O\\n        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));\\n        PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(System.out);\\n        int t = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine().trim());\\n\\n        while (t-- > 0) {\\n            StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\\n            int n = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\\n            int m = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\\n\\n            // Read the grid\\n            char[][] grid = new char[n][];\\n            for (int i = 0;

We store `compSize[id]` and track `ans0`, the maximum size seen.\\n\\n2. **Row/Column Pre-counts**  \\n   We count how many ‘#’ already lie in each row (`rowCount`) and column (`colCount`).  This will let us correct for double-counting when we merge.\\n\\n3. **Simulating “Fill Row \\\\(r\\\\)”**  \\n   - We create a horizontal strip of \\\\(m\\\\) newly guaranteed ‘#’ cells.\\n   - Any original component that touches this strip (in row \\\\(r\\\\) itself or above/below) will be merged.  \\n   - We gather those component IDs in a temporary list (deduplicating with a boolean `seen[]` array).  Summing their full sizes overcounts exactly the `rowCount[r]` many cells that were in row \\\\(r\\\\).  \\n   - So the merged component size is\\n     \\\\[\\n       m\\n       + \\\\sum_{\\\\text{touched components}} \\\\text{compSize}[id]\\n       - \\\\text{rowCount}[r].\\n     \\\\]\\n   - We take the maximum over all rows.\\n\\n4. **Simulating “Fill Column \\\\(c\\\\)”**  \\n   Analogously we form a strip of \\\\(n\\\\) new ‘#’ cells, gather the neighboring original components (from left/right or on the column), subtract `colCount[c]`, and take maximum.\\n\\n5. **Answer**  \\n   The final answer is the maximum among\\n   - `ans0` (no operation),\\n   - best among all `S_row[r]`,\\n   - best among all `S_col[c]`.\\n\\n**Complexity Analysis**\\n\\n- Flood–fill all components: \\\\(O(nm)\\\\).\\n- For each row: \\\\(O(m)\\\\) checks × \\\\(n\\\\) rows = \\\\(O(nm)\\\\).\\n- For each column: \\\\(O(n)\\\\) checks × \\\\(m\\\\) columns = \\\\(O(nm)\\\\).\\n- Total per test: \\\\(O(nm)\\\\).  Since the sum of \\\\(nm\\\\) over all tests is \\\\(\\\\le10^6\\\\), this easily runs within the time limit.  \\n- Space is \\\\(O(nm)\\\\) for the grid, component IDs, and auxiliary arrays.\",\n        \"refusal\": null,\n        \"role\": \"assistant\",\n        \"annotations\": [],\n        \"audio\": null,\n        \"function_call\": null,\n        \"tool_calls\": null\n      },\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"protected_material_code\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": true,\n          \"citation\": {\n            \"URL\": \"https://github.com/zwkatgithub/my_leetcode/tree/48b73d343b63166c7da11815f8d47b625e5784f8/problems%2F1034.%20%E8%BE%B9%E6%A1%86%E7%9D%80%E8%89%B2.md\",\n            \"license\": \"NOASSERTION\"\n          }\n        },\n        \"protected_material_text\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"created\": 1753326235,\n  \"model\": \"o4-mini-2025-04-16\",\n  \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n  \"service_tier\": null,\n  \"system_fingerprint\": null,\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"completion_tokens\": 8521,\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 830,\n    \"total_tokens\": 9351,\n    \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n      \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"reasoning_tokens\": 5760,\n      \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n    },\n    \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"cached_tokens\": 0\n    }\n  },\n  \"prompt_filter_results\": [\n    {\n      \"prompt_index\": 0,\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"jailbreak\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
