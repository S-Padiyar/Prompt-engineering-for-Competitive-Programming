The differences between the two versions are the constraints on all the variables. You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved.\n\n\n\nTsovak and Narek are playing a game. They have an array a\n\n and a matrix b\n\n of integers with n\n\n rows and m\n\n columns, numbered from 1\n\n. The cell in the i\n\n-th row and the j\n\n-th column is (i,j)\n\n.\n\n\n\nThey are looking for the elements of a\n\n in turns; Tsovak starts first. Each time a player looks for a cell in the matrix containing the current element of a\n\n (Tsovak looks for the first, then Narek looks for the second, etc.). Let's say a player has chosen the cell (r,c)\n\n. The next player has to choose his cell in the submatrix starting at (r+1,c+1)\n\n and ending in (n,m)\n\n (the submatrix can be empty if r=n\n\n or c=m\n\n). If a player cannot find such a cell (or the remaining submatrix is empty) or the array ends (the previous player has chosen the last element), then he loses.\n\n\n\nYour task is to determine the winner if the players play optimally.\n\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains t\n\n (1≤t≤300\n\n) – the number of test cases.\n\n\n\nThe first line of each test case contains three integers l\n\n, n\n\n, and m\n\n (1≤l,n,m≤300\n\n) – the size of the array and the sizes of the matrix.\n\n\n\nThe second line contains l\n\n integers a1,a2,a3,…al\n\n (1≤ai≤min(7,n⋅m)\n\n) – the elements of the array a\n\n.\n\n\n\nThe i\n\n-th of the last n\n\n lines contains m\n\n integers bi,1,bi,2,bi,3,…bi,m\n\n (1≤bi,j≤min(7,n⋅m)\n\n) – representing the i\n\n-th row of the matrix.\n\n\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n⋅m\n\n over all test cases does not exceed 105\n\n.\n\n\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of l\n\n over all test cases does not exceed 300\n\n.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nYou should output t\n\n lines, the i\n\n-th of them containing a character representing the answer of the i\n\n-th test case: \"T\" if Tsovak wins or \"N\", otherwise (without quotes).\n\n\n\nExample\n\nInputCopy\n\n3\n\n2 2 3\n\n1 2\n\n1 3 5\n\n4 5 2\n\n2 2 4\n\n1 2\n\n1 1 3 2\n\n4 2 5 1\n\n2 4 2\n\n1 2\n\n3 4\n\n5 5\n\n5 5\n\n5 5\n\nOutputCopy\n\nN\n\nT\n\nN\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, Tsovak starts by looking for 1\n\n. There is only one occurrence of 1\n\n at (1,1)\n\n, so he chooses it. Then Narek needs to look for 2\n\n in the submatrix of (2,2)\n\n, which consists of just the last two elements: 5\n\n and 2\n\n. He chooses 2\n\n, and then Tsovak loses since the array has ended.\n\n\n\nIn the second example, Tsovak needs to choose 1\n\n. There is a 1\n\n at the cell (n,m)\n\n, so he chooses that cell. Then, since the submatrix of (n+1,m+1)\n\n is empty, Narek cannot find 2\n\n, so he loses.\n\n---\n\nUse Java."

Two players, T (Tsovak) and N (Narek), alternate choosing cells of the grid in strictly down‐right order, each time matching the next value of a.  If on your turn you cannot find the required value in the remaining submatrix, you lose; also if you manage to pick the last element of a, your opponent then has no move and so loses.\\n\\nWe want to know whether the first player (T) wins under optimal play.\\n\\nA standard way is to define\\n\\n    win[k][r][c] = “from step k, with submatrix whose upper‐left corner is (r,c), the player to move has a forced win.”\\n\\nThen the recurrence is\\n\\n    win[l+1][r][c] = false  (no more targets ⇒ current player loses)\\n\\nand for k≤l,\\n\\n    win[k][r][c] = OR_{(i,j) ∈ positions of a[k], i≥r, j≥c} ( NOT win[k+1][ i+1, j+1 ] ).\\n\\nThat says: at step k you must pick some cell (i,j) matching a[k] in the current submatrix.  After that, the opponent faces step k+1 on the submatrix (i+1…n, j+1…m).  If any choice leads the opponent to a losing position, you win; if you have no legal choice you lose.\\n\\nWe only need win[1][1][1].  A direct 3D DP has size O(l·n·m) ≃ 300·300·300≈27 million booleans, and each transition might scan many cells, which is too big.  We exploit two facts:\\n\\n 1.  The values in a and b are ≤7, so there are at most 7 distinct cell‐lists to consider.\\n 2.  The recurrence for win[k] uses only win[k+1], and in fact is a 2D “suffix‐OR” over a sparse “val[r][c]” array of size n×m.\\n\\nConcretely:\\n\\n  • We maintain two 2D boolean arrays of size (n+2)×(m+2):  \\n      winNext[r][c] = win[k+1][r][c]  \\n      winCurr[r][c] = win[k][c]  \\n    (We actually only ever index r,c up to n+1,m+1; beyond the grid we treat as “false.”)\\n\\n  • To build winCurr from winNext and the k‐th target v=a[k], we first build  \\n      val[r][c] = true  \\n        exactly at those grid‐cells (r,c) whose entry b[r][c]=v _and_ for which_ winNext[r+1][c+1]==false_  \\n    (picking (r,c) forces the opponent into a losing state).  \\n\\n  • Then  \\n      winCurr[r][c] = val[r][c]  OR  winCurr[r+1][c]  OR  winCurr[r][c+1],  \\n    computed in decreasing order of r and c (so that the OR of the suffix can be formed in O(1) per cell).\\n\\n  • Finally we swap winNext⇄winCurr and proceed to k–1.\\n\\nAt the end we look at winNext[1][1] (which then is win[1][1][1]).  If true, T wins; else N wins.\\n\\nThis runs in O(l·(n·m + size_of_poslists)), and since ∑nm≤10^5, ∑l≤300, it is sufficiently fast in Java.\\n\\n---\\n\\n```java\\nimport java.io.*;\\nimport java.util.*;\\n\\npublic class Main {\\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\\n        BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));\\n        StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(in.readLine());\\n        int t = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\\n        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\\n        while (t-- > 0) {\\n            st = new StringTokenizer(in.readLine());\\n            int l = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\\n            int n = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\\n            int m = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\\n\\n            // read the target array a[1..l]\\n            int[] a = new int[l+1];\\n            st = new StringTokenizer(in.readLine());\\n            for (int i = 1; i <= l; i++) {\\n                a[i] = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\\n            }\\n\\n            // read the grid and build position‐lists for values 1..7\\n            @SuppressWarnings(\\\"unchecked\\\")\\n            ArrayList<int[]>[] pos = new ArrayList[8];\\n            for (int v = 1; v <= 7; v++) {\\n                pos[v] = new ArrayList<>();\\n            }\\n            for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\\n                st = new StringTokenizer(in.readLine());\\n                for (int j = 1; j <= m; j++) {\\n                    int v = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\\n                    // record that grid‐cell (i,j) has value v\\n                    pos[v].add(new int[]{i, j});\\n                }\\n            }\\n\\n            // We'll do DP downwards from k=l..1\\n            // winNext[r][c] = win[k+1][r][c], winCurr[r][c] = win[k][r][c]\\n            boolean[][] winNext = new boolean[n+2][m+2];\\n            boolean[][] winCurr = new boolean[n+2][m+2];\\n            // valGen trick to avoid clearing the val[][] every time\\n            int[][] valGen = new int[n+2][m+2];\\n            int gen = 1;\\n\\n            // Initialize winNext = false (this is win[l+1][r][c] = false).\\n            // Now proceed k = l down to 1:\\n            for (int k = l; k >= 1; k--, gen++) {\\n                int v = a[k];\\n                // Mark val[r][c] = true exactly where b[r][c]==v and winNext[r+1][c+1]==false\\n                for (int[] xy : pos[v]) {\\n                    int r = xy[0], c = xy[1];\\n                    if (!winNext[r+1][c+1]) {\\n                        valGen[r][c] = gen;\\n                    }\\n                }\\n                // Build winCurr as the 2D suffix‐OR of val\\n                // Borders are false:\\n                for (int c = 1; c <= m+1; c++) {\\n                    winCurr[n+1][c] = false;\\n                }\\n                for (int r = 1; r <= n; r++) {\\n                    winCurr[r][m+1] = false;\\n                }\\n                // fill the interior from bottom‐right upwards\\n                for (int r = n; r >= 1; r--) {\\n                    for (int c = m; c >= 1; c--) {\\n                        boolean canWinHere = (valGen[r][c] == gen)\\n                            || winCurr[r+1][c]\\n                            || winCurr[r][c+1];\\n                        winCurr[r][c] = canWinHere;\\n                    }\\n                }\\n                // swap winNext and winCurr for the next iteration\\n                boolean[][] tmp = winNext;\\n                winNext = winCurr;\\n                winCurr = tmp;\\n            }\\n\\n            // At the end winNext[1][1] = win[1][1][1].\\n            sb.append(winNext[1][1] ?

Then  \\n     win[k][r][c] = OR_{all i>=r, j>=c} val[i][j],  \\n   which is simply a 2D suffix‐OR that one can fill in O(n·m) by visiting the grid from bottom‐right to top‐left and doing  \\n     win[k][r][c] = val[r][c] OR win[k][r+1][c] OR win[k][r][c+1].\\n\\n5. **Rolling‐array**  \\n   We never need more than the “next” layer, so we maintain two 2D arrays `winNext` = win[k+1], `winCurr` = win[k], and swap them each iteration.\\n\\n6. **Answer**  \\n   After computing down to k=1, we examine `win[1][1][1]`.  If true, Tsovak (the first player) wins; otherwise Narek wins.\\n\\nThis runs in O(l·(n·m + total_positions)) which under the problem constraints is quite safe in Java.\",\n        \"refusal\": null,\n        \"role\": \"assistant\",\n        \"annotations\": [],\n        \"audio\": null,\n        \"function_call\": null,\n        \"tool_calls\": null\n      },\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"protected_material_code\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": true,\n          \"citation\": {\n            \"URL\": \"https://github.com/Changhwan-Son/Devlog/tree/f3cdbc9a60c3f9e3d63c25d710af943b0aba330c/content%2Fblog%2Falgorithm%2Fboj_14425.md\",\n            \"license\": \"MIT\"\n          }\n        },\n        \"protected_material_text\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"created\": 1753310046,\n  \"model\": \"o4-mini-2025-04-16\",\n  \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n  \"service_tier\": null,\n  \"system_fingerprint\": null,\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"completion_tokens\": 16850,\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 800,\n    \"total_tokens\": 17650,\n    \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n      \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"reasoning_tokens\": 14656,\n      \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n    },\n    \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"cached_tokens\": 0\n    }\n  },\n  \"prompt_filter_results\": [\n    {\n      \"prompt_index\": 0,\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"jailbreak\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
