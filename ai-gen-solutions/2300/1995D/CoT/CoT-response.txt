**Analysis**

We are given a long string `S` of length `n`, over an alphabet of size `c` (letters `'A'..`), and a maximum word‐length `k`.  We wish to “cut” the string into words of length at most `k` so that each word ends in one of a chosen subset of letters `E ⊆ {A,…}` (these letters are the “cases” of the language).  Any letter not in `E` may not be the last letter of any word.  We must cover the entire string, i.e. the last word must end exactly at position `n`.  We want to choose `E` of minimum size so that such a segmentation exists.

A well–known equivalent condition is:

  “ You can segment the string into blocks of length ≤ `k`, each block ending at a position whose letter lies in `E`, if and only if

  1) the final letter `S[n]` is in `E`, and  
  2) in every length‐`k` window of the string, there is at least one position whose letter lies in `E`. ”

Indeed, if any length‐`k` window had no allowed‐end letter, one would be forced to make a word longer than `k` to cross that window, which is illegal.  And clearly you must be able to end at `n`, so `S[n] ∈ E`.

Hence the problem reduces to a small‐universe hitting‐set problem.  There are `m = n−k+1` windows (if `n≥k`, otherwise there are zero windows).  For each window `i = 1..(n−k+1)`, let

  Lᵢ = the set of *distinct* letters appearing in `S[i..i+k−1]`.

We must choose `E` (a subset of the `c` letters) so that

  – for every window `i`, `E ∩ Lᵢ ≠ ∅`, and  
  – `S[n] ∈ E`.

We want `|E|` minimal.

Since `c ≤ 18`, we can represent any subset of letters by a bit‐mask `0..(1<<c)-1`.  We form an array

    have[mask] = 1  if  there exists some window `i` with exactly `mask` as its distinct‐letter mask.

(We only need existence, so repeatedly setting `have[mask]=1` is fine.)

Then a candidate mask `M` is **invalid** if there is at least one window whose letter‐mask `Lᵢ` has no intersection with `M`, i.e.

    `Lᵢ & M == 0`.

Equivalently, writing `U = (1<<c)-1`, the set of “bad” windows for `M` are those `Lᵢ ⊆ (U ^ M)`.  Hence `M` is invalid if and only if *some* mask `Lᵢ` is a submask of `(U^M)`.  

We precompute via a standard SOS (subset‐sum) DP an array

```
G[X] = number of window‐masks Lᵢ that are submasks of X.
```

(We only need to test `G[X]>0` or not.)  Then for each candidate `M` (such that `(M & (1<<a_n))!=0`, i.e. `M` contains the last letter), we check

   if `G[ U^M ] == 0`  
then `M` hits every window and contains the last letter, hence is valid.

We pick among those valid `M` the one of minimum popcount.  Its popcount is our answer.

Edge cases:

- If `n ≤ k` then *any* single‐letter ending that matches `S[n]` will do (there are no length‐`k` windows), so the answer is `1`.
- We must also remember to include `S[n]` in the chosen set, so we filter only those masks that have that bit set.

The overall time per test is

- O(n) to build the sliding‐window masks and mark `have[mask]`.
- O(c·2ᶜ) for the SOS‐DP.
- O(2ᶜ) to scan all masks and pick the minimum popcount.

Since ∑ n ≤ 2¹⁸ and ∑ 2ᶜ ≤ 2¹⁸ over all test cases, this easily fits under the time limit.

**Explanation of Key Steps**

1. **Reduction to a Hitting‐Set on Windows**  
   Every word has length ≤ `k` and must end in a letter from `E`.  To cross any stretch of `k` consecutive characters without an allowed‐end letter would force a word longer than `k`.  Thus every length‐`k` window must contain at least one letter from `E`.  Also the last character `S[n]` must be in `E` so as to end the final word exactly at `n`.

2. **Masking the Windows**  
   We slide a window of length `k` over `S` in O(n) time.  We maintain a count of each letter and a bit‐mask `winMask` of which letters are present.  We mark `have[winMask] = 1` for each window.  This records *which* subsets of letters appear in *some* window.

3. **SOS‐DP for Fast Validation**  
   We build an array
     
     G[mask] = ∑_{sub ⊆ mask} have[sub].

   After this “subset‐sum” (SOS) DP, `G[mask]` is simply the number of windows whose letter‐mask is a submask of `mask`.  In particular, `G[mask] > 0` means “there is at least one window `Lᵢ` with `Lᵢ ⊆ mask`.”

4. **Checking Candidate Cases**  
   A candidate set of cases is a mask `M`.  It is **invalid** iff there exists a window `Lᵢ` disjoint from `M`, i.e. `Lᵢ ⊆ (U ^ M)`, where `U=(1<<c)-1` is the full bit‐mask.  That condition is exactly `G[U^M] > 0`.  
   Hence `M` is valid iff `(M & (1<<lastLetter))≠0` (it contains the final letter) and `G[U^M] == 0` (it intersects every window).  

5. **Answer**  
   We scan all `M` in `0..(1<<c)-1`, keep those that pass the test, and take the minimum `popcount(M)`.  That is the minimum number of cases needed.

This runs in O(n + c·2^c) time per test, which is safe for the given constraints.
