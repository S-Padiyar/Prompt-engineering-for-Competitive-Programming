The differences between the two versions are the constraints on all the variables. You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved.\n\n\n\nTsovak and Narek are playing a game. They have an array a\n\n and a matrix b\n\n of integers with n\n\n rows and m\n\n columns, numbered from 1\n\n. The cell in the i\n\n-th row and the j\n\n-th column is (i,j)\n\n.\n\n\n\nThey are looking for the elements of a\n\n in turns; Tsovak starts first. Each time a player looks for a cell in the matrix containing the current element of a\n\n (Tsovak looks for the first, then Narek looks for the second, etc.). Let's say a player has chosen the cell (r,c)\n\n. The next player has to choose his cell in the submatrix starting at (r+1,c+1)\n\n and ending in (n,m)\n\n (the submatrix can be empty if r=n\n\n or c=m\n\n). If a player cannot find such a cell (or the remaining submatrix is empty) or the array ends (the previous player has chosen the last element), then he loses.\n\n\n\nYour task is to determine the winner if the players play optimally.\n\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains t\n\n (1≤t≤300\n\n) – the number of test cases.\n\n\n\nThe first line of each test case contains three integers l\n\n, n\n\n, and m\n\n (1≤l,n,m≤300\n\n) – the size of the array and the sizes of the matrix.\n\n\n\nThe second line contains l\n\n integers a1,a2,a3,…al\n\n (1≤ai≤min(7,n⋅m)\n\n) – the elements of the array a\n\n.\n\n\n\nThe i\n\n-th of the last n\n\n lines contains m\n\n integers bi,1,bi,2,bi,3,…bi,m\n\n (1≤bi,j≤min(7,n⋅m)\n\n) – representing the i\n\n-th row of the matrix.\n\n\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n⋅m\n\n over all test cases does not exceed 105\n\n.\n\n\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of l\n\n over all test cases does not exceed 300\n\n.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nYou should output t\n\n lines, the i\n\n-th of them containing a character representing the answer of the i\n\n-th test case: \"T\" if Tsovak wins or \"N\", otherwise (without quotes).\n\n\n\nExample\n\nInputCopy\n\n3\n\n2 2 3\n\n1 2\n\n1 3 5\n\n4 5 2\n\n2 2 4\n\n1 2\n\n1 1 3 2\n\n4 2 5 1\n\n2 4 2\n\n1 2\n\n3 4\n\n5 5\n\n5 5\n\n5 5\n\nOutputCopy\n\nN\n\nT\n\nN\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, Tsovak starts by looking for 1\n\n. There is only one occurrence of 1\n\n at (1,1)\n\n, so he chooses it. Then Narek needs to look for 2\n\n in the submatrix of (2,2)\n\n, which consists of just the last two elements: 5\n\n and 2\n\n. He chooses 2\n\n, and then Tsovak loses since the array has ended.\n\n\n\nIn the second example, Tsovak needs to choose 1\n\n. There is a 1\n\n at the cell (n,m)\n\n, so he chooses that cell. Then, since the submatrix of (n+1,m+1)\n\n is empty, Narek cannot find 2\n\n, so he loses.\n\n---\n\nLet's think step-by-step so we don't make mistakes. Use Java. Avoid syntax errors or infinite loops."

If any such `(r,c)` leads to a position where the opponent loses—i.e. `dp[i+1][r+1][c+1] == false`—then `dp[i][R][C]` is `true`; otherwise it is `false`.\\n\\n3. **Fast 2D range‐OR**  \\n   We mark `good[r][c] = true` exactly for those cells `(r,c)` where choosing that move is a winning move (meaning `dp[i+1][r+1][c+1] == false`).  Then  \\n     `currDP[R][C] = OR_{r>=R, c>=C} good[r][c]`.  \\n   This can be computed in \\\\(O(nm)\\\\) by the usual “suffix‐OR” scan from bottom‐right:\\n     currDP[R][C] = good[R][C] ∨ currDP[R+1][C] ∨ currDP[R][C+1].\\n\\n4. **Initialization**  \\n   We set `nextDP` (which stands for `dp[l+1]`) to all `false` because once all `l` elements are taken, the next player has no moves and loses.\\n\\n5. **Answer**  \\n   At the end of the loop `i=1`, we have filled `dp[1]` into `nextDP`.  If `nextDP[1][1]` is `true`, the first player (Tsovak) wins; otherwise, Narek wins.\\n\\nThis runs in \\\\(O\\\\bigl(l\\\\cdot n\\\\cdot m\\\\bigr)\\\\) per test, well within the limits for \\\\(l,n,m\\\\le300\\\\) and making sure the total sums of \\\\(nm\\\\) and \\\\(l\\\\) over all tests remain manageable.\",\n        \"refusal\": null,\n        \"role\": \"assistant\",\n        \"annotations\": [],\n        \"audio\": null,\n        \"function_call\": null,\n        \"tool_calls\": null\n      },\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"protected_material_code\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"protected_material_text\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"created\": 1753310153,\n  \"model\": \"o4-mini-2025-04-16\",\n  \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n  \"service_tier\": null,\n  \"system_fingerprint\": null,\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"completion_tokens\": 9308,\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 818,\n    \"total_tokens\": 10126,\n    \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n      \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"reasoning_tokens\": 7552,\n      \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n    },\n    \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"cached_tokens\": 0\n    }\n  },\n  \"prompt_filter_results\": [\n    {\n      \"prompt_index\": 0,\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"jailbreak\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
