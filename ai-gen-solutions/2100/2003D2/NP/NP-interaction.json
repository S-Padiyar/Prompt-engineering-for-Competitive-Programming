Turtle and a MEX Problem (Hard Version)\n\ntime limit per test2 seconds\n\nmemory limit per test256 megabytes\n\nThe two versions are different problems. In this version of the problem, you can't choose the same integer twice or more. You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.\n\n\n\nOne day, Turtle was playing with n\n\n sequences. Let the length of the i\n\n-th sequence be li\n\n. Then the i\n\n-th sequence was ai,1,ai,2,…,ai,li\n\n.\n\n\n\nPiggy gave Turtle a problem to solve when Turtle was playing. The statement of the problem was:\n\n\n\nThere was a non-negative integer x\n\n at first. Turtle would perform an arbitrary number (possibly zero) of operations on the integer.\n\nIn each operation, Turtle could choose an integer i\n\n such that 1≤i≤n\n\n and i\n\n wasn't chosen before, and set x\n\n to mex†(x,ai,1,ai,2,…,ai,li)\n\n.\n\nTurtle was asked to find the answer, which was the maximum value of x\n\n after performing an arbitrary number of operations.\n\nTurtle solved the above problem without difficulty. He defined f(k)\n\n as the answer to the above problem when the initial value of x\n\n was k\n\n.\n\n\n\nThen Piggy gave Turtle a non-negative integer m\n\n and asked Turtle to find the value of ∑i=0mf(i)\n\n (i.e., the value of f(0)+f(1)+…+f(m)\n\n). Unfortunately, he couldn't solve this problem. Please help him!\n\n\n\n†mex(c1,c2,…,ck)\n\n is defined as the smallest non-negative integer x\n\n which does not occur in the sequence c\n\n. For example, mex(2,2,0,3)\n\n is 1\n\n, mex(1,2)\n\n is 0\n\n.\n\n\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t\n\n (1≤t≤104\n\n). The description of the test cases follows.\n\n\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers n,m\n\n (1≤n≤2⋅105,0≤m≤109\n\n).\n\n\n\nEach of the following n\n\n lines contains several integers. The first integer li\n\n (1≤li≤2⋅105\n\n) represents the length of the i\n\n-th sequence, and the following li\n\n integers ai,1,ai,2,…,ai,li\n\n (0≤ai,j≤109\n\n) represent the elements of the i\n\n-th sequence.\n\n\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n\n\n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105\n\n and the sum of ∑li\n\n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105\n\n.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single integer — the value of ∑i=0mf(i)\n\n.\n\n\n\nExample\n\nInputCopy\n\n6\n\n3 4\n\n2 0 2\n\n3 2 3 3\n\n4 7 0 1 5\n\n3 4\n\n5 0 2 0 4 11\n\n1 1\n\n5 1 3 0 3 3\n\n2 50\n\n2 1 2\n\n2 1 2\n\n1 1\n\n7 1 2 4 1 4 9 5\n\n4 114514\n\n2 2 2\n\n5 7 3 6 0 3\n\n3 0 1 1\n\n5 0 9 2 1 5\n\n5 1919810\n\n1 2\n\n2 324003 0\n\n3 1416324 2 1460728\n\n4 1312631 2 0 1415195\n\n5 1223554 192248 2 1492515 725556\n\nOutputCopy\n\n16\n\n18\n\n1281\n\n4\n\n6556785365\n\n1842836177961\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, when x\n\n is initially 2\n\n, Turtle can choose i=3\n\n and set x\n\n to mex(x,a3,1,a3,2,a3,3,a3,4)=mex(2,7,0,1,5)=3\n\n. It can be proved that Turtle can't make the value of x\n\n greater than 3\n\n, so f(2)=3\n\n.\n\n\n\nIt can be seen that f(0)=3\n\n, f(1)=3\n\n, f(2)=3\n\n, f(3)=3\n\n, and f(4)=4\n\n.

Track the maximum \\\\(t_0\\\\) seen (call it `maxBaseMex`).\\n\\n- We build an adjacency‐list only for `v` up to `maxBaseMex`.  Any target `t1` may exceed `maxBaseMex`; in that case, when we do the DP, we simply treat \\\\(\\\\mathrm{dp}[t1]\\\\) as `t1` itself (since from `t1` there are no further “upward” edges in the small‐index graph).\\n\\n- We then do\\n  for `v = maxBaseMex` down to `0`:\\n     ```\\n       dp[v] = v\\n       for each target u in edges[v]:\\n         if u ≤ maxBaseMex:\\n           dp[v] = max(dp[v], dp[u])\\n         else\\n           dp[v] = max(dp[v], u)\\n     ```\\n- Finally we accumulate \\n  - \\\\(\\\\sum_{k=0}^{\\\\min(m,\\\\,\\\\maxBaseMex)}dp[k]\\\\), and\\n  - if \\\\(m>\\\\maxBaseMex\\\\), add \\\\(\\\\frac{m(m+1)}2-\\\\frac{\\\\maxBaseMex(\\\\maxBaseMex+1)}2\\\\).\\n\\nThe overall complexity per test is \\\\(O(\\\\sum l_i\\\\log l_i + \\\\maxBaseMex + \\\\text{total edges})\\\\), which is \\\\(O((\\\\sum l_i)\\\\log(\\\\sum l_i) + \\\\maxBaseMex)\\\\).

We scan from \\\\(0\\\\) upward to find the first missing integer \\\\(t_0\\\\).  Then we scan from \\\\(t_0+1\\\\) upward to find \\\\(t_1\\\\).  These two indices fully capture the only two ways that applying the mex operation can strictly increase \\\\(x\\\\).\\n\\n2. **Building the directed acyclic graph (DAG)**  \\n   - For each \\\\(v\\\\in A_i\\\\) with \\\\(v<t_0\\\\), we add an edge \\\\(v\\\\to t_0\\\\).  \\n   - We also add a “missing‐to‐next” edge \\\\(t_0\\\\to t_1\\\\).  \\n   All these edges go strictly upward in integer value.\\n\\n3. **Dynamic‐programming on a DAG**  \\n   Since every edge goes from a smaller node to a larger node, we can compute  \\n   \\\\[\\n     \\\\mathrm{dp}[v] \\\\;=\\\\;\\\\max\\\\Bigl(v,\\\\;\\\\max_{v\\\\to u}\\\\mathrm{dp}[u]\\\\Bigr)\\n   \\\\]\\n   in descending order of \\\\(v\\\\).  Then \\\\(\\\\mathrm{dp}[k]\\\\) is exactly the maximum value reachable from \\\\(k\\\\).\\n\\n4. **Handling large \\\\(m\\\\)**  \\n   Let \\\\(M=\\\\max_i t_0\\\\).  If \\\\(k>M\\\\), there is no outgoing “strictly upward” edge from \\\\(k\\\\), so \\\\(f(k)=k\\\\).  Thus we only really need to sum \\\\(\\\\mathrm{dp}[k]\\\\) for \\\\(k\\\\le M\\\\), and for \\\\(k>M\\\\) we just add \\\\(k\\\\).  Summing \\\\(k\\\\) from \\\\(M+1\\\\) to \\\\(m\\\\) is done by the formula for an arithmetic series.\\n\\nThe total time over all test cases is \\\\(O\\\\bigl((\\\\sum l_i)\\\\log(\\\\sum l_i)\\\\bigr)\\\\) for sorting plus \\\\(O(\\\\sum l_i)\\\\) for building edges plus \\\\(O(\\\\sum M)\\\\) for the DP and the sum.  Since \\\\(\\\\sum l_i\\\\le2\\\\cdot10^5\\\\), this passes easily.\",\n        \"refusal\": null,\n        \"role\": \"assistant\",\n        \"annotations\": [],\n        \"audio\": null,\n        \"function_call\": null,\n        \"tool_calls\": null\n      },\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"protected_material_code\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"protected_material_text\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"created\": 1753317767,\n  \"model\": \"o4-mini-2025-04-16\",\n  \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n  \"service_tier\": null,\n  \"system_fingerprint\": null,\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"completion_tokens\": 13207,\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 1211,\n    \"total_tokens\": 14418,\n    \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n      \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"reasoning_tokens\": 10048,\n      \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n    },\n    \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"cached_tokens\": 1152\n    }\n  },\n  \"prompt_filter_results\": [\n    {\n      \"prompt_index\": 0,\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"jailbreak\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
