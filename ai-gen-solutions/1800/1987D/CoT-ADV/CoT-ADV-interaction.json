First, carefully read and restate the problem in your own words to ensure full understanding. Identify the input and output formats, list the constraints, and consider any edge cases that might affect the logic. Next, determine which algorithmic pattern the problem fits best—such as greedy, binary search, two pointers, dynamic programming, or graph traversal—and briefly explain why that pattern applies. Then, plan your solution step by step, describing the key ideas, data structures, or mathematical insights you’ll use. Once your plan is clear, write a clean and fully working Java program. Use import java.util.*; and include a Main class with a main method, using Scanner or BufferedReader for input depending on the constraints. Add comments to explain important logic in the code. After coding, walk through a sample input manually to show how your solution works in practice. Finally, analyze the time and space complexity of your approach using Big-O notation, justifying your answer. Think step by step and only write code once the logic is sound and complete."

Alice and Bob play a turn‐based game:\\n\\n- Alice always goes first. On her turn, she must pick (and remove) **any** remaining cake whose tastiness is strictly greater than the maximum tastiness she has already eaten. On her very first turn she can pick any cake.\\n- Bob, on his turn, picks **any** remaining cake (no restriction except it must exist).\\n\\nThey alternate turns until the player to move cannot pick a cake (Alice has no remaining cake strictly above her personal “last” value, or Bob has no remaining cakes at all). Let \\\\(x\\\\) be the number of cakes Alice has eaten by the end. Alice tries to **maximize** \\\\(x\\\\), Bob tries to **minimize** it. We must compute the resulting \\\\(x\\\\) under optimal play.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Key Observation & Greedy Strategy**\\n\\n1.  **Alice’s best move** at any time is to pick the *smallest* cake that is still strictly above her last eaten tastiness.  By doing so she keeps her “last” as small as possible, preserving the maximum future options.\\n\\n2.  **Bob’s best countermove** is to pick the *largest* remaining cake.  Removing the largest cake each time most effectively chops off Alice’s tail of potential future picks, since Alice must always pick increasingly.\\n\\nIt turns out that this pair of greedy choices for Alice and Bob simulates the minimax outcome of the full game:\\n\\n- On Alice’s turn: remove the smallest element \\\\(> \\\\text{lastAlice}\\\\).  \\n- On Bob’s turn: remove the largest remaining element.\\n\\nWe loop until Alice cannot find any cake strictly above her last eaten, or until the multiset becomes empty after Bob’s move.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Complexities**\\n\\n- We will maintain a balanced‐tree multiset (Java’s `TreeMap<Integer,Integer>`), giving \\\\(O(\\\\log n)\\\\) insertions, deletions, and predecessor/successor queries.\\n- Each cake is removed exactly once, giving \\\\(O(n)\\\\) removal operations.        \\n- Total per test case: \\\\(O(n\\\\log n)\\\\).
