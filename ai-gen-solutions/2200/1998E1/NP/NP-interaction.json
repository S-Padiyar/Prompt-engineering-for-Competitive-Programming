Eliminating Balls With Merging (Easy Version)\n\ntime limit per test4 seconds\n\nmemory limit per test512 megabytes\n\nDrink water.\n\n— Sun Tzu, The Art of Becoming a Healthy Programmer\n\nThis is the easy version of the problem. The only difference is that x=n\n\n in this version. You must solve both versions to be able to hack.\n\n\n\nYou are given two integers n\n\n and x\n\n (x=n\n\n). There are n\n\n balls lined up in a row, numbered from 1\n\n to n\n\n from left to right. Initially, there is a value ai\n\n written on the i\n\n-th ball.\n\n\n\nFor each integer i\n\n from 1\n\n to n\n\n, we define a function f(i)\n\n as follows:\n\n\n\nSuppose you have a set S={1,2,…,i}\n\n.\n\n\n\nIn each operation, you have to select an integer l\n\n (1≤l<i\n\n) from S\n\n such that l\n\n is not the largest element of S\n\n. Suppose r\n\n is the smallest element in S\n\n which is greater than l\n\n.\n\n\n\nIf al>ar\n\n, you set al=al+ar\n\n and remove r\n\n from S\n\n.\n\nIf al<ar\n\n, you set ar=al+ar\n\n and remove l\n\n from S\n\n.\n\nIf al=ar\n\n, you choose either the integer l\n\n or r\n\n to remove from S\n\n:\n\nIf you choose to remove l\n\n from S\n\n, you set ar=al+ar\n\n and remove l\n\n from S\n\n.\n\nIf you choose to remove r\n\n from S\n\n, you set al=al+ar\n\n and remove r\n\n from S\n\n.\n\n\n\nf(i)\n\n denotes the number of integers j\n\n (1≤j≤i\n\n) such that it is possible to obtain S={j}\n\n after performing the above operations exactly i−1\n\n times.\n\nFor each integer i\n\n from x\n\n to n\n\n, you need to find f(i)\n\n.\n\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains t\n\n (1≤t≤104\n\n) — the number of test cases.\n\n\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers n\n\n and x\n\n (1≤n≤2⋅105;x=n\n\n) — the number of balls and the smallest index i\n\n for which you need to find f(i)\n\n.\n\n\n\nThe second line of each test case contains a1,a2,…,an\n\n (1≤ai≤109\n\n) — the initial number written on each ball.\n\n\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n\n\n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105\n\n.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output n−x+1\n\n space separated integers on a new line, where the j\n\n-th integer should represent f(x+j−1)\n\n.\n\n\n\nExample\n\nInputCopy\n\n3\n\n5 5\n\n1 2 3 2 1\n\n7 7\n\n4 5 1 2 1 4 5\n\n11 11\n\n1 2 3 1 1 9 3 2 4 1 3\n\nOutputCopy\n\n3\n\n4\n\n4\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, you are required to calculate f(5)\n\n. It can be shown that after 4\n\n operations, S\n\n can contain 2\n\n, 3\n\n, or 4\n\n. The following shows the operations required to make S={4}\n\n.\n\n\n\nInitially, S={1,2,3,4,5}\n\n and a=[1,2,3,2,1]\n\n.\n\nChoose l=1\n\n. Naturally, r=2\n\n. Since a1<a2\n\n, we set a2=1+2\n\n and remove 1\n\n from S\n\n. Now, S={2,3,4,5}\n\n and a=[1,3,3,2,1]\n\n.\n\nChoose l=4\n\n. Naturally, r=5\n\n. Since a4>a5\n\n, we set a4=2+1\n\n and remove 5\n\n from S\n\n. Now, S={2,3,4}\n\n and a=[1,3,3,3,1]\n\n.\n\nChoose l=3\n\n. Naturally, r=4\n\n. Since a3=a4\n\n, we have a choice whether to remove 3\n\n or 4\n\n. Since we want to preserve 4\n\n, let's remove 3\n\n. So, set a4=3+3\n\n and remove 3\n\n from S\n\n. Now, S={2,4}\n\n and a=[1,3,3,6,1]\n\n.\n\nChoose l=2\n\n. Naturally, r=4\n\n. Since a2<a4\n\n, we set a4=3+6\n\n and remove 2\n\n from S\n\n. Finally, S={4}\n\n and a=[1,3,3,9,1]\n\n.\n\nIn the second test case, you are required to calculate f(7)\n\n. It can be shown that after 6\n\n operations, S\n\n can contain 2\n\n, 4\n\n, 6\n\n, or 7\n\n.\n\n---\n\nUse Java."

Start with a “current power”  \\n      curr = \\\\(a_j\\\\).  \\n 2. Maintain two pointers  \\n      L = \\\\(j-1\\\\),  R = \\\\(j+1\\\\).  \\n    These point to the next *alive* ball immediately to the left or right of \\\\(j\\\\).  \\n 3.

The answer \\\\(f(n)\\\\) is simply the count of all \\\\(j\\\\) for which the above greedy succeeds.\\n\\nIn the worst case this is \\\\(O(n)\\\\) work per \\\\(j\\\\), hence \\\\(O(n^2)\\\\) total, which would of course TLE when \\\\(n\\\\) is up to \\\\(2\\\\times10^5\\\\).
