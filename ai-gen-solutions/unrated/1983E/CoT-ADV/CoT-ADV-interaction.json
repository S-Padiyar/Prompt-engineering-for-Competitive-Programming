There are n\n\n balls, out of which k\n\n are special. Each ball has a value associated with it.\n\n\n\nThe players play turn by turn. In each turn, the player randomly picks a ball and adds the value of the ball to their score, which is 0\n\n at the beginning of the game. The selected ball is removed from the game. If the ball was special, the same player takes the next turn if at least one ball is remaining. If the ball picked was not special, the next player plays their turn.\n\n\n\nThey play this game until no balls are remaining in the game.

First, carefully read and restate the problem in your own words to ensure full understanding. Identify the input and output formats, list the constraints, and consider any edge cases that might affect the logic. Next, determine which algorithmic pattern the problem fits best—such as greedy, binary search, two pointers, dynamic programming, or graph traversal—and briefly explain why that pattern applies. Then, plan your solution step by step, describing the key ideas, data structures, or mathematical insights you’ll use. Once your plan is clear, write a clean and fully working Java program. Use import java.util.*; and include a Main class with a main method, using Scanner or BufferedReader for input depending on the constraints. Add comments to explain important logic in the code. After coding, walk through a sample input manually to show how your solution works in practice. Finally, analyze the time and space complexity of your approach using Big-O notation, justifying your answer. Think step by step and only write code once the logic is sound and complete."

Reformulation as a random 0/1-string\\n\\nIt is well known that picking balls one by one _without_ replacement, each time uniformly from what remains, is equivalent to taking a _uniform random permutation_ of all balls and revealing them in order.  If we only look at the sequence of **types** (S or N) in that permutation, it is just a uniform random binary string of length \\\\(n\\\\) containing \\\\(k\\\\) S’s and \\\\(m=n-k\\\\) N’s.\\n\\nCall that random string\\n\\\\[\\n   T_1 T_2 \\\\dots T_n,\\\\quad\\\\text{where }T_i\\\\in\\\\{\\\\mathrm S,\\\\mathrm N\\\\}.\\n\\\\]\\nWe deal with two issues:\\n\\n1.  **Which positions go to Alice, which to Bob?**  \\n    Every time we see an “N” we switch players; an “S” does _not_ switch.  Hence if we let\\n    \\\\[\\n      \\\\text{player at position }i = \\n      \\\\begin{cases}\\n        \\\\text{Alice}, & \\\\text{if the number of N’s in }T_1\\\\ldots T_{i-1}\\\\text{ is even},\\\\\\\\\\n        \\\\text{Bob},   & \\\\text{if that number is odd},\\n      \\\\end{cases}\\n    \\\\]\\n    then \\\\(T_i\\\\) is assigned (and its value added) to that player.\\n\\n2.  **Linearity of expectation.**  \\n    By linearity of expectation, the expected total score of Alice is\\n    \\\\[\\n      \\\\sum_{i=1}^n v_i \\\\,\\\\Pr(\\\\text{Alice gets ball }i).\\n    \\\\]\\n    But all special balls are symmetric, and all ordinary balls are symmetric.  Let\\n    \\\\[\\n      S_{\\\\rm sum}=\\\\sum_{i=1}^k v_i,\\\\quad\\n      N_{\\\\rm sum}=\\\\sum_{i=k+1}^n v_i.\\n    \\\\]\\n    Then if \\\\(p_S\\\\) is the probability that _a given special ball_ goes to Alice, and \\\\(p_N\\\\) the probability that _a given ordinary ball_ goes to Alice, we get\\n    \\\\[\\n      \\\\mathbb E[\\\\text{Alice's score}]\\n        \\\\;=\\\\; S_{\\\\rm sum}\\\\,p_S \\\\;+\\\\; N_{\\\\rm sum}\\\\,p_N.\\n    \\\\]\\n\\n    Similarly Bob’s expectation is\\n    \\\\[\\n      \\\\mathbb E[\\\\text{Bob's score}]\\n        = (S_{\\\\rm sum}+N_{\\\\rm sum}) \\\\;-\\\\;\\\\mathbb E[\\\\text{Alice's score}].\\n    \\\\]\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 2. Combinatorial‐probability for \\\\(p_S\\\\) and \\\\(p_N\\\\)\\n\\nOne can do an elaborate hypergeometric calculation for \\n\\\\[\\n   p_S=\\\\Pr(\\\\text{Alice gets a fixed S in a random string}),\\n\\\\]\\nbut there is a slicker “runs and segments” argument:\\n\\n-  In any binary string of \\\\(k\\\\) S's and \\\\(m\\\\) N's, the N’s naturally split the S's into \\\\(m+1\\\\) _segments_:\\n  \\n  \\\\[\\n     \\\\underbrace{SSS\\\\dots }_{\\\\text{segment }0}\\n     N\\n     \\\\underbrace{SS\\\\dots }_{\\\\text{segment }1}\\n     N\\n     \\\\dots\\n     N\\n     \\\\underbrace{S\\\\dots }_{\\\\text{segment }m}.\\n  \\\\]\\n  \\n-  The \\\\(j\\\\)th N (for \\\\(1\\\\le j\\\\le m\\\\)) is taken by exactly the same player who took the entire segment _before_ it, and afterwards the turn flips.\\n\\n-  Thus the  \\\\(i\\\\)-th segment of S’s all go to Alice if \\\\(i\\\\) is even, to Bob if \\\\(i\\\\) is odd.  There are \\\\(m+1\\\\) segments, labeled \\\\(0,1,\\\\dots,m\\\\).\\n\\n-  Since the original string is uniform among all \\\\(\\\\binom{n}{k}\\\\) possibilities, the _expected_ size of each segment is the same:\\n  \\\\[\\n     \\\\mathbb E[\\\\text{segment}_i]\\\\;=\\\\;\\\\frac{k}{m+1}\\n     \\\\quad(\\\\text{for every }i=0,\\\\dots,m).\\n  \\\\]\\n  Hence the _expected_ number of S’s that Alice gets is\\n  \\\\[\\n     \\\\sum_{\\\\substack{i=0\\\\\\\\i\\\\text{ even}}}^{m}\\\\mathbb E[\\\\text{segment}_i]\\n     \\\\;=\\\\;\\n     \\\\Bigl(\\\\#\\\\{i\\\\le m:i\\\\text{ even}\\\\}\\\\Bigr)\\\\;\\\\frac{k}{m+1}\\\\,.\\n  \\\\]\\n  One counts:\\n  - If \\\\(m\\\\) is even, say \\\\(m=2t\\\\), the even indices among \\\\(0,1,\\\\dots,2t\\\\) are \\\\(0,2,4,\\\\dots,2t\\\\), i.e.\\\\ \\\\(t+1\\\\) many.  \\n    Thus\\n    \\\\[\\n      \\\\Pr(\\\\text{Alice gets a given S}) \\\\;=\\\\;\\n      p_S\\n      \\\\;=\\\\;\\n      \\\\frac{t+1}{m+1}\\n      \\\\;=\\\\;\\n      \\\\frac{\\\\tfrac m2+1}{m+1}\\n      \\\\;=\\\\;\\n      \\\\frac{m+2}{2\\\\,(m+1)}.\\n    \\\\]\\n  - If \\\\(m\\\\) is odd, say \\\\(m=2t+1\\\\), then even indices among \\\\(0,\\\\dots,2t+1\\\\) are \\\\(0,2,\\\\dots,2t\\\\), exactly \\\\(t+1\\\\) many, so\\n    \\\\[\\n      p_S = \\\\frac{t+1}{2t+2} = \\\\frac12.\\n    \\\\]\\n\\n-  Meanwhile **every** N\\\\(_j\\\\) (the \\\\(j\\\\)-th N in the string) is claimed by the same player as segment \\\\(j-1\\\\).  So Alice gets exactly those N’s with \\\\(j-1\\\\) even, i.e.\\\\ \\\\(j\\\\) odd.  Hence out of the \\\\(m\\\\) ordinary balls,\\n  \\\\[\\n    \\\\#\\\\{\\\\text{N’s to Alice}\\\\}\\n      = \\\\#\\\\{j=1,\\\\dots,m : j\\\\text{ odd}\\\\}\\n      = \\\\Bigl\\\\lceil\\\\frac m2\\\\Bigr\\\\rceil.\\n  \\\\]\\n  Therefore\\n  \\\\[\\n     p_N\\n     \\\\;=\\\\;\\n     \\\\frac{\\\\lceil m/2\\\\rceil}{m}\\n     \\\\;=\\\\;\\n     \\\\begin{cases}\\n       \\\\tfrac12, &m\\\\text{ even},\\\\\\\\\\n       \\\\frac{(m+1)/2}{m}=\\\\frac{m+1}{2m}, &m\\\\text{ odd}.\\n     \\\\end{cases}\\n  \\\\]\\n\\nThus we have simple closed‐form fractions:\\n\\n1.  \\\\(m=n-k\\\\).\\n\\n2.

Hence Alice gets exactly the odd-numbered ordinary balls \\\\(j=1,3,5,\\\\dots\\\\).  \\n   - Thus out of \\\\(m\\\\), she gets \\\\(\\\\bigl\\\\lceil m/2\\\\bigr\\\\rceil\\\\), so\\n     \\\\[\\n       p_N = \\\\frac{\\\\lceil m/2\\\\rceil}{m}\\n            = \\\\begin{cases}\\n               \\\\tfrac12,           & m\\\\text{ even},\\\\\\\\\\n               \\\\frac{m+1}{2m},      & m\\\\text{ odd}.\\n              \\\\end{cases}\\n     \\\\]\\n\\n4. **Putting it all together**  \\n   - Let \\n     \\\\[\\n       S_{\\\\rm sum}=\\\\sum_{i=1}^k v_i,\\\\quad N_{\\\\rm sum}=\\\\sum_{i=k+1}^n v_i.\\n     \\\\]\\n     Then\\n     \\\\[\\n       \\\\mathbb E[\\\\text{Alice}]\\n         = S_{\\\\rm sum}\\\\,p_S + N_{\\\\rm sum}\\\\,p_N\\n     \\\\]\\n     and\\n     \\\\[\\n       \\\\mathbb E[\\\\text{Bob}]\\n         = (S_{\\\\rm sum}+N_{\\\\rm sum}) \\\\;-\\\\;\\\\mathbb E[\\\\text{Alice}].\\n     \\\\]\\n   - We compute each of \\\\(p_S,p_N\\\\) as a fraction \\\\(\\\\tfrac{p_{\\\\rm num}}{p_{\\\\rm den}}\\\\) modulo \\\\(10^9+7\\\\) (using modular inverses).\\n\\nThis runs in \\\\(O(n)\\\\) total over all testcases plus \\\\(O(\\\\log\\\\,10^9)\\\\) time per inverse, well within the limits. \\n\\n---\\n\\n**Complexity**\\n\\n- We read all \\\\(n\\\\) values in \\\\(O(n)\\\\) total.\\n- For each test, we do a constant amount of arithmetic plus up to two modular inverses \\\\(\\\\,O(\\\\log MOD)\\\\).\\n- Overall time: \\\\(O\\\\bigl(\\\\sum n + t\\\\log MOD\\\\bigr)\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\sum n\\\\le 5\\\\cdot10^5\\\\) and \\\\(t\\\\le 2\\\\cdot10^5\\\\).  \\n- Memory: \\\\(O(n)\\\\) to store input lines, plus \\\\(O(1)\\\\) auxiliary.\\n\\nThis is well within the 2-second / 256 MB limits.\",\n        \"refusal\": null,\n        \"role\": \"assistant\",\n        \"annotations\": [],\n        \"audio\": null,\n        \"function_call\": null,\n        \"tool_calls\": null\n      },\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"protected_material_code\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"protected_material_text\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"created\": 1753326605,\n  \"model\": \"o4-mini-2025-04-16\",\n  \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n  \"service_tier\": null,\n  \"system_fingerprint\": null,\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"completion_tokens\": 13799,\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 1067,\n    \"total_tokens\": 14866,\n    \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n      \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"reasoning_tokens\": 10176,\n      \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n    },\n    \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"cached_tokens\": 0\n    }\n  },\n  \"prompt_filter_results\": [\n    {\n      \"prompt_index\": 0,\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"jailbreak\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
