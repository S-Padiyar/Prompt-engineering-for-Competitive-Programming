Hungry Games\n\ntime limit per test2 seconds\n\nmemory limit per test256 megabytes\n\nYaroslav is playing a computer game, and at one of the levels, he encountered n\n\n mushrooms arranged in a row. Each mushroom has its own level of toxicity; the i\n\n-th mushroom from the beginning has a toxicity level of ai\n\n. Yaroslav can choose two integers 1≤l≤r≤n\n\n, and then his character will take turns from left to right to eat mushrooms from this subsegment one by one, i.e., the mushrooms with numbers l,l+1,l+2,…,r\n\n.\n\n\n\nThe character has a toxicity level g\n\n, initially equal to 0\n\n.

First, carefully read and restate the problem in your own words to ensure full understanding. Identify the input and output formats, list the constraints, and consider any edge cases that might affect the logic. Next, determine which algorithmic pattern the problem fits best—such as greedy, binary search, two pointers, dynamic programming, or graph traversal—and briefly explain why that pattern applies. Then, plan your solution step by step, describing the key ideas, data structures, or mathematical insights you’ll use. Once your plan is clear, write a clean and fully working Java program. Use import java.util.*; and include a Main class with a main method, using Scanner or BufferedReader for input depending on the constraints. Add comments to explain important logic in the code. After coding, walk through a sample input manually to show how your solution works in practice. Finally, analyze the time and space complexity of your approach using Big-O notation, justifying your answer. Think step by step and only write code once the logic is sound and complete."

Yaroslav picks any subarray [l..r] (1≤l≤r≤n).  He starts with a running toxicity g=0 and eats mushrooms at positions l, l+1, …, r in order.  Each time he eats a mushroom of toxicity k, he does:\\n\\n  1.  g ← g + k  \\n  2.  if g > x then g ← 0  (a “reset”)  \\n\\nAfter finishing the subarray, we look at the final g.  We want to count how many subarrays have final g ≠ 0.\\n\\nA key observation is that the only way for the final g to be zero is that the last mushroom eaten at position r caused a reset.  Equivalently, when about to eat a[r], g_old + a[r] > x.  In that case he sets g=0 at that last step.  If g_old + a[r] ≤ x, then the final g = g_old + a[r] > 0.\\n\\nWe want to count subarrays [l..r] such that the eating‐process “overflow” happens exactly at r.  It turns out one can show that, for each fixed start l, the reset‐positions form a strictly increasing chain of indices s₁ < s₂ < … < sₖ (each sᵢ is where g would overflow whenever the process reaches sᵢ).  Then all and only subarrays [l..r] with r equal to one of those sᵢ end with a reset at the last step.\\n\\nWe can build this chain of overflow‐positions efficiently by a “next‐overflow” array:\\n\\n  •  nxt[i] = the smallest j ≥ i such that sum(a[i..j]) > x.  If no such j exists, we set nxt[i] = n+1.\\n\\nThen if you start eating at i, your first overflow is at j = nxt[i].  After that overflow at j, you reset g=0 and effectively start a new segment at j+1, whose first overflow is at nxt[j+1], and so on.  Thus, from a “virtual node” s = l−1 we follow directed edges\\n\\n    s → nxt[s+1] → nxt[nxt[s+1]+1] → ⋯\\n\\nEach time you land on a node ≤ n, that position is exactly one of the r’s for which [l..r] ends with a reset.  Once you jump to n+1, you’re beyond the array and the chain stops.\\n\\nBecause nxt[i] ≥ i for all i, these edges go strictly forward—no cycles—and we can in linear time compute how many steps (within 1..n) each start s makes before falling off.  Summing that count over all starts l = 1..n gives the total number of subarrays that end in a reset at r (i.e. final g = 0).  Subtracting from total subarrays n(n+1)/2 gives the number with final g ≠ 0.\\n\\nHere is a clean Java implementation using that idea.  We do:\\n\\n1. Two‐pointer sweep to compute nxt[1..n].\\n2. Build an array f[0..n], where f[i] = nxt[i+1], and treat f[n] = n+1.\\n3. DP from right to left to compute depth[i] = number of steps we can take along f–chain from i that land in [1..n].\\n4. Sum depth[0..n−1] to get the count of zero‐final‐g subarrays, subtract from n(n+1)/2, and print.\\n\\n```java\\nimport java.io.*;\\nimport java.util.*;\\n\\npublic class Main {\\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\\n        BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));\\n        StringBuilder out = new StringBuilder();\\n        int t = Integer.parseInt(in.readLine().trim());\\n        \\n        // We'll reuse arrays up to the maximum n across all test cases.\\n        int maxN = 200_000;\\n        long[] a = new long[maxN + 5];\\n        int[] nxt = new int[maxN + 5];\\n        int[] f   = new int[maxN + 5];\\n        long[] depth = new long[maxN + 5];\\n        \\n        while (t-- > 0) {\\n            StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(in.readLine());\\n            int n = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\\n            long x = Long.parseLong(st.nextToken());\\n            st = new StringTokenizer(in.readLine());\\n            for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\\n                a[i] = Long.parseLong(st.nextToken());\\n            }\\n            \\n            // 1) Build nxt[i]: first index j >= i such that sum(a[i..j]) > x.\\n            int r = 1;\\n            long sum = 0;\\n            for (int l = 1; l <= n; l++) {\\n                // Extend r while we can eat without overflow\\n                while (r <= n && sum + a[r] <= x) {\\n                    sum += a[r];\\n                    r++;\\n                }\\n                // Now either r>n or sum + a[r] > x => r is our overflow point\\n                nxt[l] = r;  // r in [l..n+1]\\n                \\n                // Slide window start forward\\n                if (r > l) {\\n                    // we had included a[l] in sum\\n                    sum -= a[l];\\n                } else {\\n                    // r == l => window is empty, force r to l+1\\n                    r = l + 1;\\n                }\\n            }\\n            \\n            // 2) Build f[i] = nxt[i+1], and set f[n] = n+1\\n            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\\n                f[i] = nxt[i + 1];\\n            }\\n            f[n] = n + 1;\\n            \\n            // 3) DP from right to left to count how many steps land inside [1..n]\\n            //    depth[i] = 0 if f[i] > n, else 1 + depth[f[i]].\\n            depth[n] = 0;\\n            for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {\\n                if (f[i] > n) {\\n                    depth[i] = 0;\\n                } else {\\n                    depth[i] = 1 + depth[f[i]];\\n                }\\n            }\\n            \\n            // 4) Sum depth[0..n-1]: that is the number of subarrays whose final g = 0\\n            long zeroCount = 0;\\n            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\\n                zeroCount += depth[i];\\n            }\\n            \\n            // Total subarrays = n*(n+1)/2\\n            long total = (long)n * (n + 1) / 2;\\n            long answer = total - zeroCount;\\n            out.append(answer).append('\\\\n');\\n        }\\n        \\n        System.out.print(out);\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nExplanation of the main steps:\\n\\n- We use a classic two‐pointer structure on \\\\[l..r−1\\\\] to keep the sum ≤ x and find the first `r` that would overflow if included.  We record that in `nxt[l] = r`.\\n- We then create a small “functional graph” on nodes 0..n pointing to `f[i] = nxt[i+1]`.  Each edge goes strictly forward (f[i] ≥ i+1), so there are no cycles and each path ends at n+1.\\n- If you start at node s = l−1, then the set of overflow‐positions for subarrays starting at l are exactly the nodes you visit (except the initial s), so the number of zero‐g subarrays with that fixed l is just the length of the forward chain from s in the graph before falling off beyond n.  We store that in `depth[s]`.\\n- Summing `depth[0..n−1]` gives the total count of subarrays whose last mushroom causes an overflow (final g = 0).  Subtracting from the total number of subarrays gives the count with final g ≠ 0.\\n\\nTime Complexity:  \\n– Building `nxt[]` with two pointers: O(n)  \\n– Building `f[]` and doing a single backward DP for `depth[]`: O(n)  \\n– Summations: O(n)  \\nTotal per test case: O(n).  Over all test cases, the sum of n is up to 2⋅10⁵, so this runs easily in under 2s.\\n\\nSpace Complexity: O(n) for the arrays.\",\n        \"refusal\": null,\n        \"role\": \"assistant\",\n        \"annotations\": [],\n        \"audio\": null,\n        \"function_call\": null,\n        \"tool_calls\": null\n      },\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"protected_material_code\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"protected_material_text\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"created\": 1753326234,\n  \"model\": \"o4-mini-2025-04-16\",\n  \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n  \"service_tier\": null,\n  \"system_fingerprint\": null,\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"completion_tokens\": 14190,\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 852,\n    \"total_tokens\": 15042,\n    \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n      \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"reasoning_tokens\": 12288,\n      \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n    },\n    \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"cached_tokens\": 0\n    }\n  },\n  \"prompt_filter_results\": [\n    {\n      \"prompt_index\": 0,\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"jailbreak\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
