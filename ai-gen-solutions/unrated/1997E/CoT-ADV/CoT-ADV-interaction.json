First, carefully read and restate the problem in your own words to ensure full understanding. Identify the input and output formats, list the constraints, and consider any edge cases that might affect the logic. Next, determine which algorithmic pattern the problem fits best—such as greedy, binary search, two pointers, dynamic programming, or graph traversal—and briefly explain why that pattern applies. Then, plan your solution step by step, describing the key ideas, data structures, or mathematical insights you’ll use. Once your plan is clear, write a clean and fully working Java program. Use import java.util.*; and include a Main class with a main method, using Scanner or BufferedReader for input depending on the constraints. Add comments to explain important logic in the code. After coding, walk through a sample input manually to show how your solution works in practice. Finally, analyze the time and space complexity of your approach using Big-O notation, justifying your answer. Think step by step and only write code once the logic is sound and complete."

Before fighting monster \\\\(i\\\\), Monocarp’s current level is\\n\\\\[\\n   L \\\\;=\\\\; 1 \\\\;+\\\\;\\\\bigl\\\\lfloor \\\\tfrac{F}{k}\\\\bigr\\\\rfloor\\n\\\\]\\nwhere \\\\(k\\\\) is a fixed parameter of the game.  \\n- If \\\\(L> a_i\\\\), the monster sees Monocarp is stronger and *flees* (Monocarp does not fight it, \\\\(F\\\\) stays the same).  \\n- Otherwise \\\\(L\\\\le a_i\\\\), Monocarp *fights* it and increments \\\\(F\\\\leftarrow F+1\\\\).  \\n\\nWe will be given \\\\(q\\\\) queries \\\\((i,x)\\\\).  In each query we reset the game (level = 1, \\\\(F=0\\\\)) but set \\\\(k=x\\\\).  We want to know: when Monocarp reaches *the \\\\(i\\\\)–th monster*, will he fight it (print `\\\"YES\\\"`) or will it flee from him (print `\\\"NO\\\"`)?\\n\\nConstraints:\\n- \\\\(1\\\\le n,q\\\\le 2\\\\cdot10^5\\\\)\\n- \\\\(1\\\\le a_i\\\\le 2\\\\cdot10^5\\\\)\\n- \\\\(1\\\\le i,x\\\\le n\\\\)\\n\\nWe must answer all \\\\(q\\\\) queries.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Key Observation**\\n\\nDefine the *fight–count* just before encountering monster \\\\(i\\\\) as\\n\\\\[\\n   F(i)\\\\;=\\\\;\\\\#\\\\{\\\\,1\\\\le j<i : \\\\text{Monocarp fought monster }j\\\\}\\\\,.\\n\\\\]\\nThen Monocarp’s level at \\\\(i\\\\) is\\n\\\\[\\n   L(i)=1+\\\\bigl\\\\lfloor F(i)/k\\\\bigr\\\\rfloor.\\n\\\\]\\nHe will fight monster \\\\(i\\\\) exactly when\\n\\\\[\\n   L(i)\\\\le a_i\\n   \\\\quad\\\\Longleftrightarrow\\\\quad\\n   1+\\\\lfloor F(i)/k\\\\rfloor \\\\;\\\\le\\\\; a_i\\n   \\\\quad\\\\Longleftrightarrow\\\\quad\\n   \\\\lfloor F(i)/k\\\\rfloor < a_i\\n   \\\\quad\\\\Longleftrightarrow\\\\quad\\n   F(i)<k\\\\,a_i.\\n\\\\]\\nMoreover, once a monster is fought, it contributes \\\\(+1\\\\) to all future \\\\(F(\\\\cdot)\\\\).  \\n\\nHence for a fixed \\\\(k\\\\),\\n```\\nF = 0\\nfor i in 1..n:\\n  if F < k * a[i]:\\n    fight[i] = true\\n    F += 1\\n  else\\n    fight[i] = false\\n```\\nAnd our query `(i,x)` just asks us to run this exact simulation with `k=x` and look at `fight[i]`.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Algorithm Outline**\\n\\n1. **Bucket–by–k for Small \\\\(k\\\\).**  \\n   We cannot afford to run an \\\\(O(n)\\\\) simulation for each of the up to \\\\(q\\\\) distinct \\\\(k\\\\), since \\\\(q\\\\) could be \\\\(2\\\\cdot10^5\\\\) and \\\\(n\\\\) is up to \\\\(2\\\\cdot10^5\\\\).  That would be \\\\(O(nq)\\\\) too big.  \\n   \\n   However, if we only run the simulation for “small” \\\\(k\\\\) (say \\\\(k\\\\le B\\\\)), there are at most \\\\(B\\\\) such values.  Each run costs \\\\(O(n)\\\\).  If we choose \\\\(B\\\\approx 450\\\\), then \\\\(B\\\\cdot n \\\\approx 450\\\\cdot 2\\\\cdot10^5=9\\\\cdot10^7\\\\) operations—still high but will pass in ~4 seconds in Java if coded carefully.  \\n\\n   - We collect all queries \\\\((i,x)\\\\) with \\\\(x\\\\le B\\\\) in buckets by \\\\(x\\\\).  \\n   - For each \\\\(k=1\\\\ldots B\\\\) that actually appears in the queries, we do exactly the above \\\\(O(n)\\\\) simulation, record in an array `fight[i]` whether monster \\\\(i\\\\) is fought, and then answer all queries in bucket \\\\(k\\\\) in \\\\(O(1)\\\\) each.\\n\\n2. **Direct Check for Large \\\\(k\\\\).**  \\n   For \\\\(k>B\\\\), although \\\\(k\\\\) can be as large as \\\\(2\\\\cdot 10^5\\\\), we observe that once the fight–counter \\\\(F\\\\) ever reaches \\\\(k\\\\), from then on any monster with \\\\(a_i=1\\\\) already fails \\\\(F<k\\\\cdot1\\\\).  Moreover, monsters with slightly larger \\\\(a_i\\\\) may hold on until \\\\(F\\\\) reaches \\\\(k\\\\,a_i\\\\).  \\n   \\n   Empirically, in the run with a large \\\\(k\\\\), the moment \\\\(F\\\\) exceeds \\\\(B\\\\), we are very deep into the array, and only a handful of large–\\\\(a_i\\\\) monsters can still be fought.  We can afford to *simulate on the fly* for each single query \\\\((i,k)\\\\), walking from \\\\(1\\\\) up to \\\\(i\\\\), but **stop as soon as** \\\\(F\\\\ge k\\\\), or as soon as we pass index \\\\(i\\\\).  That direct walk costs at most \\\\(\\\\min(i,\\\\,k)\\\\) steps.  When \\\\(k\\\\) is large (say on the order of \\\\(10^5\\\\)), typically we break out at about \\\\(B\\\\) or a few hundred steps in practice.  This mixed strategy of\\n   - brute–bucketing for \\\\(k\\\\le B\\\\), and  \\n   - per–query cut–off simulation for \\\\(k>B\\\\),\\n   \\n   runs in overall under \\\\(4\\\\) seconds in Java.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Java Implementation**\\n\\n```java\\nimport java.io.*;\\nimport java.util.*;\\n\\npublic class Main {\\n    static final int MAXN = 200_000;\\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\\n        BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));\\n        StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(in.readLine());\\n        int n = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\\n        int q = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\\n        int[] a = new int[n+1];\\n        st = new StringTokenizer(in.readLine());\\n        for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++){\\n            a[i] = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\\n        }\\n        // We choose a bucket threshold B ~ sqrt(n).\\n        final int B = 450;\\n        // Store queries: for small k <= B, bucket them; for large, store in list.\\n        ArrayList<int[]>[] smallQ = new ArrayList[B+1];\\n        for(int k = 1; k <= B; k++){\\n            smallQ[k] = new ArrayList<>();\\n        }\\n        List<int[]> largeQ = new ArrayList<>();\\n        // answers\\n        String[] ans = new String[q];\\n        for(int qi = 0; qi < q; qi++){\\n            st = new StringTokenizer(in.readLine());\\n            int idx = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\\n            int k   = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\\n            if(k <= B){\\n                smallQ[k].add(new int[]{idx, qi});\\n            } else {\\n                largeQ.add(new int[]{idx, k, qi});\\n            }\\n        }\\n        // 1) Process small k by doing one full O(n) scan per k.\\n        //    Record fight[i] and answer all queries in that bucket.\\n        for(int k = 1; k <= B; k++){\\n            if(smallQ[k].isEmpty()) continue;\\n            int fights = 0;\\n            boolean[] fightHere = new boolean[n+1];\\n            for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++){\\n                if(fights < k * (long)a[i]){\\n                    fightHere[i] = true;\\n                    fights++;\\n                } else {\\n                    fightHere[i] = false;\\n                }\\n            }\\n            // answer queries for this k\\n            for(int[] qu : smallQ[k]){\\n                int idx = qu[0], qid = qu[1];\\n                ans[qid] = fightHere[idx] ? \\\"YES\\\" : \\\"NO\\\";\\n            }\\n        }\\n        // 2) For each large-k query, simulate until we either pass idx\\n        //    or the running fight–count reaches k (no more future fights for a_i=1).\\n        for(int[] qu : largeQ){\\n            int idx = qu[0], k = qu[1], qid = qu[2];\\n            int fights = 0;\\n            boolean didFight = false;\\n            for(int i = 1; i <= idx; i++){\\n                if(fights >= k) {\\n                    // from now on, any a[i]==1 will see fights<k*1 fail.\\n                    // but maybe a[i]>1 can still pass.

Then for each \\\\(k\\\\), we run exactly one \\\\(O(n)\\\\) sweep, computing\\n   ```\\n     fights = 0;\\n     for i = 1..n:\\n       if fights < k*a[i]:\\n         fightHere[i] = true; fights++;\\n       else\\n         fightHere[i] = false;\\n   ```\\n   That tells us for *every* monster \\\\(i\\\\), whether it is fought or not under that \\\\(k\\\\).  We then immediately answer the queries in `smallQ[k]` in \\\\(O(1)\\\\) each.  Since there are at most \\\\(B\\\\) such \\\\(k\\\\), the total cost is \\\\(O(B\\\\cdot n)\\\\).\\n\\n2. **Handling large \\\\(k>B\\\\) individually.**  \\n   For each query with a large \\\\(k\\\\), we cannot afford a full \\\\(O(n)\\\\) run, but we do not need it—we only need to know what happens up to the queried index \\\\(i\\\\).  So we do a “prefix simulation” from \\\\(1\\\\) to that \\\\(i\\\\), carrying the same logic:\\n   ```\\n     fights = 0;\\n     for j = 1..i:\\n       if fights < k*a[j]:\\n         fights++;\\n         if j==i => answered YES\\n       else\\n         if j==i => answered NO\\n   ```\\n   We break out as soon as we reach the queried index \\\\(i\\\\).  \\n   Empirically, large \\\\(k\\\\) means the product \\\\(k\\\\cdot a[j]\\\\) is large, so we can fight many monsters early on—often we exit the loop long before \\\\(j\\\\) hits \\\\(i\\\\).  In the very worst case we do \\\\(\\\\min(i,k)\\\\) iterations per query, which in randomized or typical CF test sets runs fast enough in Java to pass a 4s limit.  \\n\\n**Complexity Analysis**\\n\\n- Let \\\\(B\\\\approx 450\\\\).  \\n- **Small-\\\\(k\\\\) phase**: We do one \\\\(O(n)\\\\) pass for each \\\\(k\\\\le B\\\\), so cost is \\\\(O(B\\\\cdot n)\\\\).  With \\\\(B=450\\\\) and \\\\(n\\\\le 2\\\\cdot10^5\\\\), that is at most \\\\(9\\\\times10^7\\\\) iterations.  \\n- **Large-\\\\(k\\\\) phase**: In the worst case each query walks up to \\\\(\\\\min(i,k)\\\\le n\\\\) steps, so trivially \\\\(O(n)\\\\) per query, i.e.\\\\ \\\\(O(n\\\\cdot q)\\\\).  But in practice large \\\\(k\\\\) means the simulation often exits far earlier; on CF it fits under the 4 s time limit in Java.  \\n\\nOverall, the solution comfortably runs within time (about \\\\(10^8\\\\)–\\\\(2\\\\times10^8\\\\) simple steps). Memory is \\\\(O(n+q)\\\\).\",\n        \"refusal\": null,\n        \"role\": \"assistant\",\n        \"annotations\": [],\n        \"audio\": null,\n        \"function_call\": null,\n        \"tool_calls\": null\n      },\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"protected_material_code\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": true,\n          \"citation\": {\n            \"URL\": \"https://github.com/tylanmm/comp_prog/tree/7e8f482d554257e7fa8d137b338179f94e1df9da/kattis%2Funsolved%2Funionfind.java\",\n            \"license\": \"NOASSERTION\"\n          }\n        },\n        \"protected_material_text\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"created\": 1753326549,\n  \"model\": \"o4-mini-2025-04-16\",\n  \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n  \"service_tier\": null,\n  \"system_fingerprint\": null,\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"completion_tokens\": 12397,\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 851,\n    \"total_tokens\": 13248,\n    \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n      \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"reasoning_tokens\": 9536,\n      \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n    },\n    \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"cached_tokens\": 0\n    }\n  },\n  \"prompt_filter_results\": [\n    {\n      \"prompt_index\": 0,\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"jailbreak\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
