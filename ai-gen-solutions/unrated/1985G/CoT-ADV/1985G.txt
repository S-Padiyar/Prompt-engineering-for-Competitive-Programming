Let D(n)
 represent the sum of digits of n
. For how many integers n
 where 10l≤n<10r
 satisfy D(k⋅n)=k⋅D(n)
? Output the answer modulo 109+7
.

Input
The first line contains an integer t
 (1≤t≤104
) – the number of test cases.

Each test case contains three integers l
, r
, and k
 (0≤l<r≤109
, 1≤k≤109
).

Output
For each test case, output an integer, the answer, modulo 109+7
.

Note
For the first test case, the only values of n
 that satisfy the condition are 1
 and 2
.

For the second test case, the only values of n
 that satisfy the condition are 1
, 10
, and 11
.

For the third test case, all values of n
 between 10
 inclusive and 100
 exclusive satisfy the condition.
