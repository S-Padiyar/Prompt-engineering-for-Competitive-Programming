K1o0n gave you an array a
 of length n
, consisting of numbers 1,2,…,n
. Accept it? Of course! But what to do with it? Of course, calculate MEOW(a)
.

Let MEX(S,k)
 be the k
-th positive (strictly greater than zero) integer in ascending order that is not present in the set S
. Denote MEOW(a)
 as the sum of MEX(b,|b|+1)
, over all distinct subsets b
 of the array a
.

Examples of MEX(S,k)
 values for sets:

MEX({3,2},1)=1
, because 1
 is the first positive integer not present in the set;
MEX({4,2,1},2)=5
, because the first two positive integers not present in the set are 3
 and 5
;
MEX({},4)=4
, because there are no numbers in the empty set, so the first 4
 positive integers not present in it are 1,2,3,4
.
Input
The first line contains a single integer t
 (1≤t≤104
) — the number of test cases.

In a single line of each test case, an integer n
 (1≤n≤5000
) is entered, the size of the array of gifted numbers.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n2
 over all test cases does not exceed 25⋅106
.

Output
For each test case, output a single number — MEOW(a)
. Since it may be very large, output it modulo 109+7
.
