**Analysis**

We have an array a of length n and a positive integer k.  At each step, if the current length of the array is still greater than k we must delete a contiguous block of exactly k elements.  Eventually the array shrinks to length

  m =  
    n,      if n ≤ k  
    n mod k, if n > k and n mod k > 0  
    k,     if n > k and n mod k = 0  

(One checks that when n > k, deleting exactly t = ⌈(n−k)/k⌉ blocks of size k leaves m = n − t·k elements, and this m is exactly what the formula above gives.)

We then must choose exactly one element to keep from each of the first m residue‐classes modulo k (namely positions whose 1-based index is ≡1,2,…,m (mod k)).  One can show that *any* valid sequence of k-deletions that ends with exactly **m** survivors has picked exactly one surviving element from each of these m residue‐classes.  Hence the final array of size m consists of exactly one element from each class.

We now want the resulting **median** of that final m-element array to be as large as possible.  Since the final array has length m, its median index is

  med_idx = ⌊(m+1)/2⌋  (1‐based)

but the condition “median ≥ X” means that *all* of the first med_idx elements (after sorting) are ≥ X.  Equivalently, the number of survivors ≥ X must be at least

  need = m − med_idx + 1 = ⌈(m+1)/2⌉  
  (which is equal to ⌊m/2⌋+1).

To maximize that median, we simply look *within each residue class* to see the largest element we could choose from that class.  Denote

  M[j] = the maximum of all a[i] with i ≡ j (mod k),

for j = 1,2,…,m.  We must pick exactly one survivor from each class, and in as many of them as possible we’d like to pick something ≥ X.  Thus to test a candidate X we count how many of the M[j] ≥ X;  we need at least **need** of them.  

But instead of binary‐searching X, we observe that the best we can do is to sort the array M[1…m] in descending order and pick the **need-th largest** of the M[j].  That value is our answer.

Overall each test case takes:

- O(n) to bucket into the k classes (but we only need the first m ≤ k).
- O(m log m) to sort the m maxima.
- Constant extra.

Since ∑n ≤ 5·10^5 over all test cases, this runs easily in time.

**Explanation of Key Steps**

1. **Final array length `m`.**  
   One can show that if you must keep deleting blocks of size k until the length is at most k, you end up with  
   &nbsp;&nbsp;• m = n if n ≤ k  
   &nbsp;&nbsp;• otherwise m = n mod k, unless n mod k = 0 in which case you get exactly k survivors.

2. **Residue classes.**  
   A standard “block‐removal” argument shows that *exactly one* element survives in each of the first m residue classes of the form { i ∣ i≡1,2,…,m (mod k) }.

3. **Max per class.**  
   In class j (1-based), the best choice of a survivor is simply  
     \( M[j] = \max\{\,a[i]\mid i\equiv j\pmod k\}\,. \)

4. **Finding the maximum median.**  
   A final array of size m has median index `floor((m+1)/2)`.  In order for that median to be at least X, at least  
   \[
     \text{need} \;=\;\bigl\lceil\frac{m+1}{2}\bigr\rceil
   \]
   of the survivors must be ≥ X.  Hence to get the largest possible X, we sort the m values `M[1…m]` in descending order and pick the `need`-th largest.

This runs in O(n + m log m) per test, and ∑n≤5⋅10^5 ensures it is fast enough for the given limits.
