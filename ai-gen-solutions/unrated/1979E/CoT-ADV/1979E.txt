time limit per test3 seconds
memory limit per test256 megabytes
The Manhattan distance between two points (x1,y1)
 and (x2,y2)
 is defined as:
|x1−x2|+|y1−y2|.

We call a Manhattan triangle three points on the plane, the Manhattan distances between each pair of which are equal.

You are given a set of pairwise distinct points and an even integer d
. Your task is to find any Manhattan triangle, composed of three distinct points from the given set, where the Manhattan distance between any pair of vertices is equal to d
.

Input
Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains one integer t
 (1≤t≤104
) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n
 and d
 (3≤n≤2⋅105
, 2≤d≤4⋅105
, d
 is even) — the number of points and the required Manhattan distance between the vertices of the triangle.

The (i+1)
-th line of each test case contains two integers xi
 and yi
 (−105≤xi,yi≤105
) — the coordinates of the i
-th point. It is guaranteed that all points are pairwise distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n
 over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105
.

Output
For each test case, output three distinct integers i
, j
, and k
 (1≤i,j,k≤n
) — the indices of the points forming the Manhattan triangle. If there is no solution, output "0 0 0
" (without quotes).

If there are multiple solutions, output any of them.

Note
In the first test case:

Points A
, B
, and F
 form a Manhattan triangle, the Manhattan distance between each pair of vertices is 4
. Points D
, E
, and F
 can also be the answer.
In the third test case:

Points A
, C
, and E
 form a Manhattan triangle, the Manhattan distance between each pair of vertices is 6
.
In the fourth test case, there are no two points with a Manhattan distance of 4
, and therefore there is no suitable Manhattan triangle.
