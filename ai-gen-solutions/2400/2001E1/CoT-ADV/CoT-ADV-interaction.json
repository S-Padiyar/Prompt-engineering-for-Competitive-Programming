Deterministic Heap (Easy Version)\n\ntime limit per test3 seconds\n\nmemory limit per test512 megabytes\n\nThis is the easy version of the problem. The difference between the two versions is the definition of deterministic max-heap, time limit, and constraints on n\n\n and t\n\n. You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved.\n\n\n\nConsider a perfect binary tree with size 2n−1\n\n, with nodes numbered from 1\n\n to 2n−1\n\n and rooted at 1\n\n. For each vertex v\n\n (1≤v≤2n−1−1\n\n), vertex 2v\n\n is its left child and vertex 2v+1\n\n is its right child. Each node v\n\n also has a value av\n\n assigned to it.\n\n\n\nDefine the operation pop\n\n as follows:\n\n\n\ninitialize variable v\n\n as 1\n\n;\n\nrepeat the following process until vertex v\n\n is a leaf (i.e. until 2n−1≤v≤2n−1\n\n);\n\namong the children of v\n\n, choose the one with the larger value on it and denote such vertex as x\n\n; if the values on them are equal (i.e. a2v=a2v+1\n\n), you can choose any of them;\n\nassign ax\n\n to av\n\n (i.e. av:=ax\n\n);\n\nassign x\n\n to v\n\n (i.e. v:=x\n\n);\n\nassign −1\n\n to av\n\n (i.e. av:=−1\n\n).\n\nThen we say the pop\n\n operation is deterministic if there is a unique way to do such operation. In other words, a2v≠a2v+1\n\n would hold whenever choosing between them.\n\n\n\nA binary tree is called a max-heap if for every vertex v\n\n (1≤v≤2n−1−1\n\n), both av≥a2v\n\n and av≥a2v+1\n\n hold.\n\n\n\nA max-heap is deterministic if the pop\n\n operation is deterministic to the heap when we do it for the first time.\n\n\n\nInitially, av:=0\n\n for every vertex v\n\n (1≤v≤2n−1\n\n), and your goal is to count the number of different deterministic max-heaps produced by applying the following operation add\n\n exactly k\n\n times:\n\n\n\nChoose an integer v\n\n (1≤v≤2n−1\n\n) and, for every vertex x\n\n on the path between 1\n\n and v\n\n, add 1\n\n to ax\n\n.\n\nTwo heaps are considered different if there is a node which has different values in the heaps.\n\n\n\nSince the answer might be large, print it modulo p\n\n.\n\n\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t\n\n (1≤t≤500\n\n). The description of the test cases follows.\n\n\n\nThe first line of each test case contains three integers n,k,p\n\n (1≤n,k≤500\n\n, 108≤p≤109\n\n, p\n\n is a prime).\n\n\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n\n\n and the sum of k\n\n over all test cases does not exceed 500\n\n.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single line containing an integer: the number of different deterministic max-heaps produced by applying the aforementioned operation add\n\n exactly k\n\n times, modulo p\n\n.\n\n\n\nExamples\n\nInputCopy\n\n7\n\n1 13 998244353\n\n2 1 998244353\n\n3 2 998244853\n\n3 3 998244353\n\n3 4 100000037\n\n4 2 100000039\n\n4 3 100000037\n\nOutputCopy\n\n1\n\n2\n\n12\n\n52\n\n124\n\n32\n\n304\n\nInputCopy\n\n1\n\n500 500 100000007\n\nOutputCopy\n\n76297230\n\nInputCopy\n\n6\n\n87 63 100000037\n\n77 77 100000039\n\n100 200 998244353\n\n200 100 998244353\n\n32 59 998244853\n\n1 1 998244353\n\nOutputCopy\n\n26831232\n\n94573603\n\n37147649\n\n847564946\n\n727060898\n\n1\n\nNote\n\nFor the first testcase, there is only one way to generate a\n\n, and such sequence is a deterministic max-heap, so the answer is 1\n\n.\n\n\n\nFor the second testcase, if we choose v=1\n\n and do the operation, we would have a=[1,0,0]\n\n, and since a2=a3\n\n, we can choose either of them when doing the first pop\n\n operation, so such heap is not a deterministic max-heap.\n\n\n\nAnd if we choose v=2\n\n, we would have a=[1,1,0]\n\n, during the first pop\n\n, the following would happen:\n\n\n\ninitialize v\n\n as 1\n\nsince a2v>a2v+1\n\n, choose 2v\n\n as x\n\n, then x=2\n\nassign ax\n\n to av\n\n, then a=[1,1,0]\n\nassign x\n\n to v\n\n, then v=2\n\nsince v\n\n is a leaf, assign −1\n\n to av\n\n, then a=[1,−1,0]\n\nSince the first pop\n\n operation is deterministic, this is a deterministic max-heap. Also, if we choose v=3\n\n, a\n\n would be a deterministic max-heap, so the answer is 2\n\n.\n\n---\n\nYou are a competitive programming assistant solving Codeforces problems using Java. First, carefully read and restate the problem in your own words to ensure full understanding. Identify the input and output formats, list the constraints, and consider any edge cases that might affect the logic. Next, determine which algorithmic pattern the problem fits best—such as greedy, binary search, two pointers, dynamic programming, or graph traversal—and briefly explain why that pattern applies. Then, plan your solution step by step, describing the key ideas, data structures, or mathematical insights you’ll use. Once your plan is clear, write a clean and fully working Java program. Use import java.util.*; and include a Main class with a main method, using Scanner or BufferedReader for input depending on the constraints. Add comments to explain important logic in the code. After coding, walk through a sample input manually to show how your solution works in practice. Finally, analyze the time and space complexity of your approach using Big-O notation, justifying your answer. Think step by step and only write code once the logic is sound and complete."

A depth-1 subtree is just one leaf, so for any\\n    \\\\(t\\\\ge0\\\\) there is exactly one way to put \\\\(a_{\\\\rm leaf}=t\\\\).

By symmetry there are two choices\\n    for the root comparison, and *then* in either case exactly\\n    \\\\(B[n][k]\\\\) ways to continue.  So we multiply by \\\\(2\\\\).

But so far we have\\n    enforced “strict left>right” only at the root of the depth-\\\\(n\\\\)\\n    subtree.  In the full heap we must have a strict comparison at each\\n    of the \\\\(n-1\\\\) levels *along the actual pop path*, and that path\\n    could go either left or right at each of those \\\\(n-1\\\\) levels.
