Sasha has two binary strings s
 and t
 of the same length n
, consisting of the characters 0 and 1.

There is also a computing machine that can perform two types of operations on binary strings a
 and b
 of the same length k
:

If ai=ai+2=
 0, then you can assign bi+1:=
 1 (1≤i≤k−2
).
If bi=bi+2=
 1, then you can assign ai+1:=
 1 (1≤i≤k−2
).
Sasha became interested in the following: if we consider the string a=slsl+1…sr
 and the string b=tltl+1…tr
, what is the maximum number of 1 characters in the string a
 that can be obtained using the computing machine. Since Sasha is very curious but lazy, it is up to you to answer this question for several pairs (li,ri)
 that interest him.

Input
Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t
 (1≤t≤104
) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n
 (1≤n≤2⋅105
) — the length of the strings s
 and t
.

The second line of each test case contains a binary string s
 of length n
, consisting of the characters 0 and 1.

The third line of each test case contains a binary string t
 of length n
, consisting of the characters 0 and 1.

The fourth line of each test case contains a single integer q
 (1≤q≤2⋅105
) — the number of queries.

The i
-th of the following lines contains two integers li
 and ri
 (1≤li≤ri≤n
) — the boundaries of the i
-th pair of substrings that interest Sasha.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n
 over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105
 and the sum of q
 over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105
.

Output
For each test case, output q
 integers — the answers to all queries.

Note
In the first test case:

In the first query, a=
 11, so the maximum number of 1 characters is 2
.
In the second query, a=
 111, so the maximum number of 1 characters is 3
.
In the second test case:

In the first query, a=
 101 and b=
 110. No operations can be performed, so the maximum number of 1 characters is 2
.
In the second query, a=
 1010 and b=
 1101. Since a2=a4=
 0, we can assign b3:=
 1. Now b1=b3=
 1, so we can assign a2:=
 1. The string a
 becomes 1110, so the maximum number of 1 characters is 3
.
