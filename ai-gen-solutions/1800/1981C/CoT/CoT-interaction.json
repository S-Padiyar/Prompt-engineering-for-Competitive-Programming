Turtle and an Incomplete Sequence\n\ntime limit per test3 seconds\n\nmemory limit per test256 megabytes\n\nTurtle was playing with a sequence a1,a2,…,an\n\n consisting of positive integers. Unfortunately, some of the integers went missing while playing.\n\n\n\nNow the sequence becomes incomplete. There may exist an arbitrary number of indices i\n\n such that ai\n\n becomes −1\n\n. Let the new sequence be a′\n\n.\n\n\n\nTurtle is sad. But Turtle remembers that for every integer i\n\n from 1\n\n to n−1\n\n, either ai=⌊ai+12⌋\n\n or ai+1=⌊ai2⌋\n\n holds for the original sequence a\n\n.\n\n\n\nTurtle wants you to help him complete the sequence. But sometimes Turtle makes mistakes, so you need to tell him if you can't complete the sequence.\n\n\n\nFormally, you need to find another sequence b1,b2,…,bn\n\n consisting of positive integers such that:\n\n\n\nFor every integer i\n\n from 1\n\n to n\n\n, if a′i≠−1\n\n, then bi=a′i\n\n.\n\nFor every integer i\n\n from 1\n\n to n−1\n\n, either bi=⌊bi+12⌋\n\n or bi+1=⌊bi2⌋\n\n holds.\n\nFor every integer i\n\n from 1\n\n to n\n\n, 1≤bi≤109\n\n.\n\nIf there is no sequence b1,b2,…,bn\n\n that satisfies all of the conditions above, you need to report −1\n\n.\n\n\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t\n\n (1≤t≤105\n\n). The description of the test cases follows.\n\n\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer n\n\n (2≤n≤2⋅105\n\n) — the length of the sequence.\n\n\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n\n\n integers a′1,a′2,…,a′n\n\n (a′i=−1\n\n or 1≤a′i≤108\n\n) — the elements of the sequence a′\n\n.\n\n\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n\n\n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105\n\n.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, if there is no sequence b1,b2,…,bn\n\n that satisfies all of the conditions, output a single integer −1\n\n.\n\n\n\nOtherwise, output n\n\n integers b1,b2,…,bn\n\n — the elements of the sequence b1,b2,…,bn\n\n you find. The sequence should satisfy that 1≤bi≤109\n\n for every integer i\n\n from 1\n\n to n\n\n.

We:\\n   - Compute the binary strings of \\\\(S_0\\\\) and \\\\(S_1\\\\).\\n   - Find their LCA by common prefix.\\n   - Compute the minimal distance \\\\(d_\\\\min\\\\).\\n   - Check feasibility: \\\\((r-\\\\ell)\\\\ge d_\\\\min\\\\) and parity matches.\\n   - If feasible, we build the path by:\\n     1. Doing \\\\(\\\\tfrac{(r-\\\\ell)-d_\\\\min}{2}\\\\) cycles \\\\((\\\\text{down→up})\\\\) to burn extra steps.\\n     2. Doing the exact \\\"up\\\" moves from \\\\(S_0\\\\) to LCA,\\n     3. Then the exact \\\"down\\\" moves along the binary‐suffix of \\\\(S_1\\\\).\\n   - We write the intermediate values into positions \\\\(\\\\ell+1,\\\\dots,r-1\\\\).  \\n\\n5. **Filling a single‐known segment**  \\n   If only the *left* end is given, we simply alternate “down→up” (or \\\"up→down\\\") to fill the desired length, which always exists and never violates the \\\\(1\\\\le b_i\\\\le10^9\\\\) bound.
