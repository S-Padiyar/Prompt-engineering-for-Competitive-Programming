time limit per test2 seconds
memory limit per test512 megabytes
Consider an array a
 of n
 integers, where every element is from 1
 to k
, and every integer from 1
 to k
 appears at least once.

Let the array b
 be constructed as follows: for the i
-th element of a
, bi
 is the distance to the closest element in a
 which is not equal to ai
. In other words, bi=minj∈[1,n],aj≠ai|i−j|
.

For example, if a=[1,1,2,3,3,3,3,1]
, then b=[2,1,1,1,2,2,1,1]
.

Calculate the number of different arrays b
 you can obtain if you consider all possible arrays a
, and print it modulo 998244353
.

Input
The only line of the input contains two integers n
 and k
 (2≤n≤2⋅105
; 2≤k≤min(n,10)
).

Output
Print one integer — the number of different arrays b
 you can obtain, taken modulo 998244353
.
