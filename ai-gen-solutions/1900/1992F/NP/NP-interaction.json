We must cut the array into a minimum number of contiguous “bad” segments so that in each segment there is no sub‐multiset of its elements whose product is exactly x.\\n\\nA key observation is that any card whose value **does not** divide x can never help form x (if you include it, you introduce prime factors outside those of x, so the product cannot be x), and you can always ignore those cards in your subset.  Hence such cards are “harmless” – they cannot participate in a dangerous subset – and we may entirely skip them in our product‐subset DP.\\n\\nOn the other hand, cards whose value divides x are exactly the ones we must watch.  Call such a value d—they are divisors of x—and throw away the others for DP purposes.\\n\\nWe want to detect the first time (in index order) that a dangerous subset appears ending at position i.  More precisely, if there is a subset whose product is exactly x and whose **last** index is i, then let ℓᵢ be the minimal index in that subset.  Any segment that **starts** at or before ℓᵢ and **ends** ≥ i would contain that dangerous subset and so would be invalid.  Therefore we must cut so that no segment starts ≤ ℓᵢ and ends ≥ i.  In a dynamic‐programming/parsing view, if we let\\n\\n  posᵢ = max(posᵢ₋₁, ℓᵢ)  \\n\\nthen by index i we have banned all segment‐starts ≤posᵢ; any valid segment ending at i must start at an index >posᵢ.\\n\\nWe then do a straightforward 1D DP on the array:  \\n  dp[i] = 1 + min{ dp[j] : posᵢ ≤ j < i }.\\n\\nBecause posᵢ is nondecreasing in i, we can maintain that sliding‐window minimum with a little deque in O(1) amortized per step.\\n\\nThe only remaining work is to compute ℓᵢ efficiently.  To do that we\\n\\n1.  Factor x, enumerate its divisors (there are at most a few hundred for x≤10⁵).\\n2.  Build a small “subset‐sum‐in‐exponent‐space” DP over those divisors.  \\n3.  As we scan from left to right, we keep an array f[s] = the smallest index at which one can form divisor s by multiplying a sub‐multiset of the **useful** cards seen so far.  (Initialize all to ∞.)\\n4.  When we see a new card aᵢ that divides x, let d = aᵢ, and let r = x/d (as divisors).  If f[r]≠∞, that means already in the prefix there is a subset whose product =r, so by including the new card d we get a subset of product x ending at i.  The minimal index in that subset is min( f[r], i ); in fact it is f[r].  That is ℓᵢ.\\n5.  Then we update the DP f[·] by “inserting” the new divisor d (i.e. run a small O(D) loop that merges d with all previously reachable divisors).\\n\\nSince the number D of divisors of x is typically ≤128, each step costs O(D), for an overall O(n·D) ≲10⁷ total work across all testcases.  The sliding‐window DP also costs O(n).\\n\\nBelow is a Java implementation of exactly that.  It runs in O(n·#div(x) + n) per test, comfortably within the 4s limit for ∑n≤10⁵.\\n\\n```java\\nimport java.io.*;\\nimport java.util.*;\\n\\npublic class Main {\\n    static final int INF = 1000000000;\\n    // We'll reuse this array to map divisor-value -> its index in 'divs'.\\n    static int[] val2idx = new int[100001];

They can never help form exactly x.  \\n2.  **Maintain a tiny subset‐sum DP** over the divisors of x.  Let f[s] = the earliest index at which some subset of the _useful_ cards seen so far multiplies to divisor `divs[s]`.  \\n3.  When we see a new card `d = a[i]` that divides x, we ask: can we already form `x/d`?  That is `if f[ rem[d_state] ] < ∞`.  If so, we have a dangerous subset ending at i, whose minimal index is `f[ rem[d_state] ]`.  We call that ℓᵢ.  \\n4.  We keep a running `pos = max(pos, ℓᵢ)`.  Any segment ending at i must start >pos to avoid including that dangerous subset.  \\n5.  We do a standard 1D DP  \\n       dp[i] = 1 + min{ dp[j] : pos ≤ j < i }  \\n   with a small deque to maintain the window‐minimum in O(1) amortized time.  \\n6.  We update our tiny divisor‐DP `f[·]` by inserting the new divisor exactly as in a “0/1 knapsack” over at most ~100 states.\\n\\nThis solves the problem in O(n·#divisors(x)) time per test, which is more than fast enough for ∑n≤10⁵ and x≤10⁵.\",\n        \"refusal\": null,\n        \"role\": \"assistant\",\n        \"annotations\": [],\n        \"audio\": null,\n        \"function_call\": null,\n        \"tool_calls\": null\n      },\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"protected_material_code\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": true,\n          \"citation\": {\n            \"URL\": \"https://github.com/mr-arora30/CP_SERIES/tree/47d55d36da08532731d2d311e1d9496f8648a7e7/Codeforces%2Fsrc%2Fcom%2Fcf694%2FA.java\",\n            \"license\": \"NOASSERTION\"\n          }\n        },\n        \"protected_material_text\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"created\": 1753309679,\n  \"model\": \"o4-mini-2025-04-16\",\n  \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n  \"service_tier\": null,\n  \"system_fingerprint\": null,\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"completion_tokens\": 19371,\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 603,\n    \"total_tokens\": 19974,\n    \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n      \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"reasoning_tokens\": 16576,\n      \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n    },\n    \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"cached_tokens\": 0\n    }\n  },\n  \"prompt_filter_results\": [\n    {\n      \"prompt_index\": 0,\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"jailbreak\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
