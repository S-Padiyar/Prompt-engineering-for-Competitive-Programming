We want to turn *all* cells white using two kinds of operations:\\n\\n1.  Paint an entire row white, cost \\\\(1\\\\).\\n2.  Paint a \\\\(2\\\\times2\\\\) sub‐square white, cost \\\\(1\\\\).\\n\\nWe wish to cover (i.e.\\\\ turn white) all the black cells at minimum total cost.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Reformulation\\n\\n-  Let \\\\(b_i = \\\\bigl\\\\lceil \\\\tfrac{a_i}{2}\\\\bigr\\\\rceil\\\\).  Why this definition?\\n   -  An isolated row of length \\\\(a_i\\\\) would require \\\\(\\\\lceil a_i/2\\\\rceil\\\\) *horizontal domino*‐like moves of length 2 to clear by \\\\(2\\\\times2\\\\) squares (if no neighbor were helping), because each such square laid *partly* in that row can cover at most 2 black cells in that row.  \\n   -  Thus \\\\(b_i\\\\) is the “demand” of row \\\\(i\\\\) in units of 2‐cell blocks.\\n\\n-  Any \\\\(2\\\\times2\\\\) paint squares we place along the horizontal boundary between rows \\\\(i\\\\) and \\\\(i+1\\\\) we index by an integer \\\\(x_i\\\\).  Each such square contributes **1** block to row \\\\(i\\\\) *and* **1** block to row \\\\(i+1\\\\).  \\n-  A “row‐paint” on row \\\\(i\\\\) costs \\\\(1\\\\) but instantly satisfies *all* \\\\(b_i\\\\) demand for that row.\\n\\nThus we get a one‐dimensional “cover‐demand” problem on the path of rows:\\n\\n-  We choose nonnegative integers \\\\(x_1,\\\\dots,x_{n-1}\\\\), each costing \\\\(+\\\\,x_i\\\\).\\n-  We may also choose to pay a “row–paint” on row \\\\(i\\\\), costing \\\\(+1\\\\), which frees us from having to meet row \\\\(i\\\\)'s demand from its neighbors.\\n-  If we do *not* row‐paint row \\\\(i\\\\), then we must have\\n   \\\\[\\n      x_{i-1} + x_i \\\\;\\\\ge\\\\; b_i,\\n   \\\\]\\n   so that the “squares from above \\\\((x_{i-1})\\\\) plus from below \\\\((x_i)\\\\)” supply enough 2‐units to cover row \\\\(i\\\\).  \\n\\nWe wish to minimize\\n\\\\[\\n   \\\\Bigl(\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} x_i\\\\Bigr)\\n   \\\\;+\\\\;\\n   (\\\\text{number of rows we chose to paint whole})\\\\,.\\n\\\\]\\n\\nThat becomes a small dynamic‐programming on a path:\\n\\n-  Let \\\\(\\\\mathrm{dp}_i(c)\\\\) = the minimum cost to handle rows \\\\(1\\\\ldots i\\\\) with a “carry” of \\\\(c = x_i\\\\) squares ready to supply row \\\\(i\\\\!+\\\\!1\\\\).  \\n-  We process row \\\\(i\\\\) with demand \\\\(b_i\\\\).  For each old state \\\\((c_{\\\\mathrm{old}},\\\\mathrm{cost}_{\\\\mathrm{old}})\\\\), we can either\\n\\n   1.  **Pay a row‐paint** for row \\\\(i\\\\).  \\n       -  That satisfies row \\\\(i\\\\) no matter what \\\\(c_{\\\\mathrm{old}}\\\\) is.  \\n       -  We **do not** need to bring in any new squares, so we set \\\\(x_i=0\\\\).  \\n       -  Transition cost = \\\\(\\\\mathrm{cost}_{\\\\mathrm{old}} + 1\\\\).  \\n       -  New carry = \\\\(0\\\\).\\n\\n   2.  **Do _not_ pay** a row‐paint for row \\\\(i\\\\).  \\n       -  Then we must supply \\\\(b_i\\\\) out of \\\\(c_{\\\\mathrm{old}} + x_i\\\\).  \\n       -  Hence we must choose\\n         \\\\[\\n            x_i \\\\;=\\\\; \\\\max\\\\{\\\\,0,\\\\;b_i - c_{\\\\mathrm{old}}\\\\}\\\\,,\\n         \\\\]\\n         which is the *smallest* new squares that makes\\n         \\\\(\\n            c_{\\\\mathrm{old}} + x_i \\\\ge b_i\\n         \\\\)\\n         just exact (no \\\"extra waste\\\" for row \\\\(i\\\\)).\\n       -  Transition cost = \\\\(\\\\mathrm{cost}_{\\\\mathrm{old}} + x_i\\\\).\\n       -  New carry = \\\\(x_i\\\\).\\n\\nWe then keep a map (or sorted vector) of \\\\((\\\\text{carry}\\\\to\\\\text{best cost})\\\\) and prune *dominated* states:\\n\\n-  If two states have carries \\\\(c_1 < c_2\\\\) and also \\\\(\\\\mathrm{cost}_1 \\\\ge \\\\mathrm{cost}_2\\\\), then carrying \\\\(c_1\\\\) is never better than carrying \\\\(c_2\\\\).  We drop dominated states.\\n\\nFinally, after processing row \\\\(n\\\\), the answer is the minimum cost among all carries.\\n\\nWe also observe a tiny optimization: if \\\\(b_i=0\\\\), row \\\\(i\\\\) has no demand, so clearly we do neither squares nor a row‐paint; we can collapse all the old DP states into a single state “carry \\\\(=0\\\\)” with cost = minimum of the old costs.  This saves a lot of DP‐blowup on zero‐black rows.\\n\\nOverall the complexity is \\\\(O\\\\bigl(\\\\sum_i (\\\\text{DP‐states at step }i)\\\\log(\\\\cdots)\\\\bigr)\\\\), which in practice on CF constraints \\\\(\\\\sum n\\\\le2\\\\cdot10^5\\\\) is efficient.\\n\\n---\\n\\n```java\\nimport java.io.*;\\nimport java.util.*;\\n\\npublic class Main {\\n    static class FastReader {\\n        BufferedReader br;\\n        StringTokenizer st;\\n        FastReader(InputStream in){ br=new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(in)); }\\n        String next() {\\n            while (st==null || !st.hasMoreTokens()) {\\n                try { st=new StringTokenizer(br.readLine()); }\\n                catch(IOException e){ throw new RuntimeException(e); }\\n            }\\n            return st.nextToken();\\n        }\\n        int nextInt(){ return Integer.parseInt(next()); }\\n    }\\n\\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\\n        FastReader in = new FastReader(System.in);\\n        PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(System.out);\\n\\n        int t = in.nextInt();\\n        while(t-->0) {\\n            int n = in.nextInt();\\n            int[] a = new int[n];\\n            for(int i=0;i<n;i++) {\\n                a[i] = in.nextInt();\\n            }\\n            // b[i] = ceil(a[i]/2)\\n            int[] b = new int[n];\\n            for(int i=0;i<n;i++){\\n                b[i] = (a[i]+1)/2;\\n            }\\n\\n            // dp holds pairs (carry -> best cost).\\n            // Start at i=0 with carry=0, cost=0.\\n            TreeMap<Integer,Integer> dp = new TreeMap<>();\\n            dp.put(0, 0);\\n\\n            for(int i=0;i<n;i++){\\n                int need = b[i];\\n                // If need==0, we can collapse all carries to (0 -> minCost).\\n                if(need==0){\\n                    int best = Integer.MAX_VALUE;\\n                    for(int c: dp.values()){\\n                        best = Math.min(best, c);\\n                    }\\n                    dp.clear();\\n                    dp.put(0, best);\\n                    continue;\\n                }\\n                // Otherwise, do the two transitions per old state:\\n                //  1) pay row-paint => carry'=0, cost+1\\n                //  2) no paint: carry' = max(0, need - carry), cost += carry'\\n                TreeMap<Integer,Integer> next = new TreeMap<>();\\n\\n                for(Map.Entry<Integer,Integer> e: dp.entrySet()){\\n                    int carryOld = e.getKey();\\n                    int costOld  = e.getValue();\\n                    // (1) row-paint:\\n                    int c1 = 0;\\n                    int cost1 = costOld + 1;\\n                    next.merge(c1, cost1, Math::min);\\n\\n                    // (2) no row-paint:\\n                    int x = need - carryOld;\\n                    if(x < 0) x = 0;  // no deficit\\n                    int c2 = x;\\n                    int cost2 = costOld + x;\\n                    next.merge(c2, cost2, Math::min);\\n                }\\n\\n                // Prune dominated states: if carry2>carry1 and cost2<=cost1 then (carry1) is never better.\\n                TreeMap<Integer,Integer> pruned = new TreeMap<>();\\n                int bestSoFar = Integer.MAX_VALUE;\\n                // Iterate in descending carry\\n                for(int c : next.descendingKeySet()){\\n                    int cst = next.get(c);\\n                    if(cst < bestSoFar) {\\n                        // keep\\n                        pruned.put(c, cst);\\n                        bestSoFar = cst;\\n                    }\\n                }\\n                dp = pruned;\\n            }\\n\\n            // Final answer = min cost among all carries\\n            int ans = Integer.MAX_VALUE;\\n            for(int c: dp.values()){\\n                ans = Math.min(ans, c);\\n            }\\n            out.println(ans);\\n        }\\n        out.flush();\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Explanation of Key Steps**\\n\\n1.
