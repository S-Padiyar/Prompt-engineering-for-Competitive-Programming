Malformed secondary AI response for Problem ID 1995B2, round 3:
“The current code loses the special handling when x = 1 (prices {1,2}), so two‐type pairs with x=1 can never improve the answer. Please reintroduce the x=1 case:

- If x==1 and c1>0, you can fill every coin exactly, so consider sum=m.
- If x==1 and c1==0, you can only buy 2‐petal flowers, so consider sum=2*min(c2, m/2).

Keep your corrected `bmax = min(c2, k, rem/(x+1))` logic for x>1.  Return the complete Java solution in one cohesive code block ready for submission.
