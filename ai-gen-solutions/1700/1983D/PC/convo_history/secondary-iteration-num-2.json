Swap Dilemma\n\ntime limit per test1 second\n\nmemory limit per test256 megabytes\n\nGiven two arrays of distinct positive integers a\n\n and b\n\n of length n\n\n, we would like to make both the arrays the same. Two arrays x\n\n and y\n\n of length k\n\n are said to be the same when for all 1≤i≤k\n\n, xi=yi\n\n.\n\n\n\nNow in one move, you can choose some index l\n\n and r\n\n in a\n\n (l≤r\n\n) and swap al\n\n and ar\n\n, then choose some p\n\n and q\n\n (p≤q\n\n) in b\n\n such that r−l=q−p\n\n and swap bp\n\n and bq\n\n.\n\n\n\nIs it possible to make both arrays the same?\n\n\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t\n\n (1≤t≤2⋅104\n\n). The description of the test cases follows.\n\n\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer n\n\n (1≤n≤105\n\n) — the length of the arrays a\n\n and b\n\n.\n\n\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n\n\n distinct integers a1,a2,a3,…,an\n\n (1≤ai≤2⋅105\n\n) — the integers in the array a\n\n.\n\n\n\nThe third line of each test case contains n\n\n distinct integers b1,b2,b3,…,bn\n\n (1≤bi≤2⋅105\n\n) — the integers in the array b\n\n.\n\n\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n\n\n over all test cases does not exceed 105\n\n.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each testcase, print \"YES\" if the arrays a\n\n and b\n\n can be made the same. Otherwise, print \"NO\". can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\", and \"YES\" will be recognized as positive responses.\n\n\n\nExample\n\nInputCopy\n\n6\n\n4\n\n1 2 3 4\n\n1 2 3 4\n\n5\n\n1 3 4 2 5\n\n7 1 2 5 4\n\n4\n\n1 2 3 4\n\n4 3 2 1\n\n3\n\n1 2 3\n\n1 3 2\n\n5\n\n1 5 7 1000 4\n\n4 1 7 5 1000\n\n3\n\n1 4 2\n\n1 3 2\n\nOutputCopy\n\nYES\n\nNO\n\nYES\n\nNO\n\nNO\n\nNO\n\nNote\n\nIn the first testcase, you don't need to perform any operations since the arrays are same.\n\n\n\nIn the second testcase, it can be proven there exists no way to make the arrays same.\n\n\n\nIn the third testcase, one of the ways to make the arrays same is to first choose l=1\n\n, r=3\n\n, p=1\n\n, q=3\n\n then choose l=1\n\n, r=2\n\n, p=3\n\n, q=4\n\n.\n\nUse Java."

    "content": "First, note that if \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) do not have exactly the same set of values (they are both given as “distinct‐integer” arrays, but need not be permutations of each other), the answer is immediately NO.  Otherwise one can consider the permutation \\(R\\) on indices \\(\\{1,\\dots,n\\}\\) defined by\n\n\\[\n   R(i)\\;=\\;\\text{the index \\(j\\) with }b_j = a_i.\n\\]\n\n  Equivalently you build a map from each value in \\(b\\) to its position, then for each \\(i\\) set\n\\[\n   R(i)\\;=\\;\\mathrm{pos}_b\\bigl(a_i\\bigr).\n\\]\n  \nOne checks that \\(R\\) is indeed a permutation of \\(\\{1,\\dots,n\\}\\).  We then look at the cycle–decomposition of \\(R\\).  The (somewhat surprising) necessary–and–sufficient condition is\n\n    –  Count how many of the cycles in \\(R\\) have even length.  \n    –  If that number is odd, answer NO; otherwise answer YES.\n\nThat test runs in \\(O(n)\\) per test: you build the inverse–map of \\(b\\), form \\(R\\), do one DFS/visited–array pass to find all its cycles and tally up how many have even length.
