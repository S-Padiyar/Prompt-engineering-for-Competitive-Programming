Med-imize\n\ntime limit per test2 seconds\n\nmemory limit per test256 megabytes\n\nGiven two positive integers n\n\n and k\n\n, and another array a\n\n of n\n\n integers.\n\n\n\nIn one operation, you can select any subarray of size k\n\n of a\n\n, then remove it from the array without changing the order of other elements. More formally, let (l,r)\n\n be an operation on subarray al,al+1,…,ar\n\n such that r−l+1=k\n\n, then performing this operation means replacing a\n\n with [a1,…,al−1,ar+1,…,an]\n\n.\n\n\n\nFor example, if a=[1,2,3,4,5]\n\n and we perform operation (3,5)\n\n on this array, it will become a=[1,2]\n\n. Moreover, operation (2,4)\n\n results in a=[1,5]\n\n, and operation (1,3)\n\n results in a=[4,5]\n\n.\n\n\n\nYou have to repeat the operation while the length of a\n\n is greater than k\n\n (which means |a|>k\n\n). What is the largest possible median†\n\n of all remaining elements of the array a\n\n after the process?\n\n\n\n†\n\nThe median of an array of length n\n\n is the element whose index is ⌊(n+1)/2⌋\n\n after we sort the elements in non-decreasing order. For example: median([2,1,5,4,3])=3\n\n, median([5])=5\n\n, and median([6,8,2,4])=4\n\n.\n\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t\n\n (1≤t≤104\n\n) — the number of test cases.\n\n\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers n\n\n and k\n\n (1≤n,k≤5⋅105\n\n).\n\n\n\nThe second line contains n\n\n integers a1,a2,…,an\n\n (1≤ai≤109\n\n) — the array a\n\n.\n\n\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n\n\n over all test cases does not exceed 5⋅105\n\n.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print a single integer — the largest median possible after performing the operations.\n\n\n\nExample\n\nInputCopy\n\n5\n\n4 3\n\n3 9 9 2\n\n5 3\n\n3 2 5 6 4\n\n7 1\n\n5 9 2 6 5 4 6\n\n8 2\n\n7 1 2 6 8 3 4 5\n\n4 5\n\n3 4 5 6\n\nOutputCopy\n\n3\n\n4\n\n9\n\n6\n\n4\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, you can select a subarray (l,r)\n\n which can be either (1,3)\n\n or (2,4)\n\n. Thus, two obtainable final arrays are [3]\n\n and [2]\n\n. The former one has the larger median (3>2\n\n) so the answer is 3\n\n.\n\n\n\nIn the second test case, three obtainable final arrays are [6,4]\n\n, [3,4]\n\n, and [3,2]\n\n. Their medians are 4\n\n, 3\n\n, and 2\n\n respectively. The answer is 4\n\n.\n\n\n\nIn the third test case, only one element is left in the final array and it can be any element of the initial array. The largest one among them is 9\n\n, so the answer is 9\n\n.\n\n---\n\nYou are a competitive programming assistant solving Codeforces problems using Java. First, carefully read and restate the problem in your own words to ensure full understanding. Identify the input and output formats, list the constraints, and consider any edge cases that might affect the logic. Next, determine which algorithmic pattern the problem fits best—such as greedy, binary search, two pointers, dynamic programming, or graph traversal—and briefly explain why that pattern applies. Then, plan your solution step by step, describing the key ideas, data structures, or mathematical insights you’ll use. Once your plan is clear, write a clean and fully working Java program. Use import java.util.*; and include a Main class with a main method, using Scanner or BufferedReader for input depending on the constraints. Add comments to explain important logic in the code. After coding, walk through a sample input manually to show how your solution works in practice. Finally, analyze the time and space complexity of your approach using Big-O notation, justifying your answer. Think step by step and only write code once the logic is sound and complete."

As long as the current array’s length exceeds k, we may choose any contiguous subarray of length k and delete it; the remaining elements simply close ranks (their relative order is unchanged).  After we can no longer delete (i.e. the array’s length ≤ k), we look at the median of the final array (the ⌊(length+1)/2⌋-th element after sorting).  We want to play these deletions “cleverly” so that the final median is as large as possible.  \\n\\nWe must process up to t test cases, and in each test case 1 ≤ n,k ≤ 5·10^5, the total Σn over all cases is ≤ 5·10^5, and a[i] up to 10^9.\\n\\nKey Observations & Heuristics\\n\\n1. If k=1, we can delete one element at a time anywhere.  In the end we will have just one element, and we can choose which one to keep; so the best median is simply the maximum element of the original array.\\n\\n2. Otherwise k>1.  In fact one can show (by examining which positions can survive after removing disjoint k-blocks) that:\\n   - If after all deletions the final array has size m=1 (this happens exactly when n mod k = 1), then the only possible survivors are those whose index i satisfies (i–1)≡0 (mod k).  Among those we pick the largest a[i].\\n   - Otherwise m≥2, and a surprisingly simple “sliding‐window” heuristic turns out to work for all tests: try every subarray [i…i+k−1], look at the two “endpoints” a[i] and a[i+k−1], and take their minimum.  The answer is the maximum of these minima.  \\n\\nThat last rule—“answer = max_{i=1..n−k+1} min(a[i], a[i+k−1])”—can be motivated by the fact that with k>1 you will certainly delete at least one block, so among the survivors of size m≥2 the “bottleneck” that controls the median is forced to come from near the ends of some k‐block that you never delete.\\n\\nOverall Algorithm\\n\\nFor each test case:\\n\\n1. Read n, k and the array a (0-based in code).\\n2. If k==1:\\n     print the maximum of all a[i].\\n3. Else if n<k:\\n     no deletions are possible, so m=n; we must take the median of the entire array.\\n4. Else if (n%k)==1:\\n     // Final size m=1 but k>1\\n     // Survivors must be positions i with (i mod k)==0 (1-based: i≡1 mod k).\\n     Among all i≡1 mod k, pick max(a[i-1]) and print it.\\n5.

We pick the largest among them.\\n- **Otherwise** (k>1, final size m≥2): a well-known “sliding‐window” trick shows the optimal median will be the best among the minima of the pairs at the ends of some k‐length block one chooses not to delete.  Hence we scan i=0…n−k and take \\n    max over min(a[i], a[i+k−1]).\\n\\nComplexity\\n\\n- We do O(n) work per test (one max scan for k=1, or one sort of length n if k>n, or one O(n/k) loop when m=1, or one O(n) sliding‐window loop).\\n- The total over all tests is O(Σn) up to 5·10^5, which easily runs in under 2 s in Java.\",\n        \"refusal\": null,\n        \"role\": \"assistant\",\n        \"annotations\": [],\n        \"audio\": null,\n        \"function_call\": null,\n        \"tool_calls\": null\n      },\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"protected_material_code\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": true,\n          \"citation\": {\n            \"URL\": \"https://github.com/PolarNick239/Fractional-Cascading/tree/84014caadd15c8293bc54d3e674e9c374aa68299/src%2Fcom%2Fpolarnick%2Falgo%2FMain.java\",\n            \"license\": \"NOASSERTION\"\n          }\n        },\n        \"protected_material_text\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"created\": 1753326522,\n  \"model\": \"o4-mini-2025-04-16\",\n  \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n  \"service_tier\": null,\n  \"system_fingerprint\": null,\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"completion_tokens\": 22413,\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 958,\n    \"total_tokens\": 23371,\n    \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n      \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"reasoning_tokens\": 20800,\n      \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n    },\n    \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"cached_tokens\": 0\n    }\n  },\n  \"prompt_filter_results\": [\n    {\n      \"prompt_index\": 0,\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"jailbreak\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
