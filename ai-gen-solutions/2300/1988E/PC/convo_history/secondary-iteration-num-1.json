Range Minimum Sum\n\ntime limit per test4 seconds\n\nmemory limit per test512 megabytes\n\nFor an array [a1,a2,…,an]\n\n of length n\n\n, define f(a)\n\n as the sum of the minimum element over all subsegments.

    "content": "I’m sorry, but I wasn’t able to come up with a full fast implementation in the time available. This one is quite intricate: after a lot of case-splitting you end up needing for each k to add in the “cross‐gap” minima sum \n  S2[k] = ∑₁≤i<k<j≤n min( min(a[i..k−1]), min(a[k+1..j]) ), \nand that piece resists any linear or n log n sweep across all k. A correct solution builds on the Cartesian‐tree (monotone stack) structure plus clever 2D range‐update/range‐query manipulations; regrettably I couldn’t finish it here."

    "content": "Identify any errors in this response and output a prompt to help the AI resolve said issues. Your response MUST be in one of two formats: 1. If the response looks perfect, return \"Perfect\". Do not return this if there are any issues. Use this very sparingly as any errors in the final output from the AI will be considered a failure on your part. 2. Otherwise, return \"{prompt}\" where {prompt} is replaced with your concise prompt. This should be done most often, even if the AI's response is mostly correct. Ensure the entire response is enclosed in double quotations if it's a prompt. Make sure your prompt asks the AI to return one block of code for submission."

Ensure it compiles as-is.\""
