Penchick and Chloe's Trees\n\ntime limit per test3.5 seconds\n\nmemory limit per test512 megabytes\n\n\n\nWith just a few hours left until Penchick and Chloe leave for Singapore, they could hardly wait to see the towering trees at the Singapore Botanic Gardens! Attempting to contain their excitement, Penchick crafted a rooted tree to keep Chloe and himself busy.\n\n\n\nPenchick has a rooted tree∗\n\n consisting of n\n\n vertices, numbered from 1\n\n to n\n\n, with vertex 1\n\n as the root, and Chloe can select a non-negative integer d\n\n to create a perfect binary tree†\n\n of depth d\n\n.\n\n\n\nSince Penchick and Chloe are good friends, Chloe wants her tree to be isomorphic‡\n\n to Penchick's tree. To meet this condition, Chloe can perform the following operation on her own tree any number of times:\n\n\n\nSelect an edge (u,v)\n\n, where u\n\n is the parent of v\n\n.\n\nRemove vertex v\n\n and all the edges connected to v\n\n, then connect all of v\n\n's previous children directly to u\n\n.\n\nIn particular, doing an operation on an edge (u,v)\n\n where v\n\n is a leaf will delete vertex v\n\n without adding any new edges.\n\n\n\nSince constructing a perfect binary tree can be time-consuming, Chloe wants to choose the minimum d\n\n such that a perfect binary tree of depth d\n\n can be made isomorphic to Penchick's tree using the above operation. Note that she can't change the roots of the trees.\n\n\n\n∗\n\nA tree is a connected graph without cycles. A rooted tree is a tree where one vertex is special and called the root. The parent of vertex v\n\n is the first vertex on the simple path from v\n\n to the root. The root has no parent. A child of vertex v\n\n is any vertex u\n\n for which v\n\n is the parent. A leaf is any vertex without children.\n\n\n\n†\n\nA full binary tree is rooted tree, in which each node has 0\n\n or 2\n\n children. A perfect binary tree is a full binary tree in which every leaf is at the same distance from the root. The depth of such a tree is the distance from the root to a leaf.\n\n\n\n‡\n\nTwo rooted trees, rooted at r1\n\n and r2\n\n respectively, are considered isomorphic if there exists a permutation p\n\n of the vertices such that an edge (u,v)\n\n exists in the first tree if and only if the edge (pu,pv)\n\n exists in the second tree, and pr1=r2\n\n.\n\n\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t\n\n (1≤t≤105\n\n). The description of the test cases follows.\n\n\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer n\n\n (2≤n≤106\n\n) — the number of vertices in Penchick's tree.\n\n\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n−1\n\n integers p2,p3,…,pn\n\n (1≤pi≤i−1\n\n) — the parent of vertex i\n\n.\n\n\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n\n\n over all test cases does not exceed 106\n\n.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single integer on each line: the minimum depth of Chloe's perfect binary tree.\n\n\n\nExample\n\nInputCopy\n\n5\n\n6\n\n1 2 2 1 1\n\n15\n\n1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 5 6 6 7 7\n\n5\n\n1 2 2 2\n\n7\n\n1 1 2 1 1 2\n\n10\n\n1 1 1 2 2 2 4 3 3\n\nOutputCopy\n\n2\n\n3\n\n3\n\n3\n\n3\n\nNote\n\nFor the first test case, create a perfect binary tree with depth 2\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider carrying out the operation on edge AC\n\n. Then the edges AC\n\n, CF\n\n, and CG\n\n are removed, and edges AF\n\n and AG\n\n are added.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe resulting tree is isomorphic to the tree given in the input. It can be proven that no sequence of operations carried out on a binary tree of depth less than 2\n\n can lead to a tree isomorphic to the tree given in the input.\n\n\n\nIn the second test case, the tree is already isomorphic to a perfect binary tree of depth 3\n\n.\n\n---\n\nYou are a competitive programming assistant solving Codeforces problems using Java. First, carefully read and restate the problem in your own words to ensure full understanding. Identify the input and output formats, list the constraints, and consider any edge cases that might affect the logic. Next, determine which algorithmic pattern the problem fits best—such as greedy, binary search, two pointers, dynamic programming, or graph traversal—and briefly explain why that pattern applies. Then, plan your solution step by step, describing the key ideas, data structures, or mathematical insights you’ll use. Once your plan is clear, write a clean and fully working Java program. Use import java.util.*; and include a Main class with a main method, using Scanner or BufferedReader for input depending on the constraints. Add comments to explain important logic in the code. After coding, walk through a sample input manually to show how your solution works in practice. Finally, analyze the time and space complexity of your approach using Big-O notation, justifying your answer. Think step by step and only write code once the logic is sound and complete."

Chloe starts with a perfect binary tree of depth \\\\(d\\\\) (i.e.\\\\ exactly \\\\(2^{d+1}-1\\\\) nodes, full and all leaves at distance \\\\(d\\\\) from the root).  She may repeatedly “contract” any parent–child edge \\\\((u,v)\\\\) by deleting \\\\(v\\\\) and reattaching all of \\\\(v\\\\)’s children directly to \\\\(u\\\\).  Deleting a leaf just removes that leaf.  After a sequence of such contractions, her tree must become isomorphic (as a rooted unordered tree) to the given tree \\\\(T\\\\).  Find the minimum \\\\(d\\\\) for which this is possible.\\n\\nKey observations:\\n\\n1.  In a perfect binary tree of depth \\\\(d\\\\), every node except the \\\\(2^d\\\\) leaves has exactly 2 children; all leaves are at distance exactly \\\\(d\\\\) from the root.\\n\\n2.  When we contract an edge \\\\((u,v)\\\\), we remove \\\\(v\\\\) and splice its children upward.  Thus what once was two levels of the perfect tree can collapse into one, or more.  In the end, any node of Chloe’s final tree corresponds to some node at some depth in the original perfect tree, and each parent–child in the final must correspond to a (non‐empty) chain of perfect‐tree edges that have all been contracted.\\n\\n3.  To embed \\\\(T\\\\) into a depth-\\\\(d\\\\) perfect binary tree we must choose, for each node \\\\(x\\\\) of \\\\(T\\\\), some node \\\\(f(x)\\\\) in the perfect tree so that\\n     a) \\\\(f(1)\\\\) is the root,\\n     b) if \\\\(p\\\\) is the parent of \\\\(x\\\\) in \\\\(T\\\\), then \\\\(f(x)\\\\) lies strictly below \\\\(f(p)\\\\), and\\n     c) whenever two different children of \\\\(x\\\\) map to two nodes in the perfect tree, those two nodes must not “require” contradictory contractions on the same perfect‐tree edge.\\n\\nIf you work it out (the full details are in the official editorial), you can show a simple bottom-up DP:\\n\\nDefine \\\\(\\\\displaystyle dp[v]\\\\) = the minimum height \\\\(h\\\\) of a perfect‐binary subtree (rooted at the image of v) required so that, after internal contractions *inside* that subtree, you can realize the entire subtree of \\\\(T\\\\) below \\\\(v\\\\).\\n\\nBase case: If \\\\(v\\\\) is a leaf of \\\\(T\\\\), then \\\\(dp[v]=0\\\\).\\n\\nOtherwise let \\\\(v\\\\) have \\\\(k\\\\) children \\\\(c_1,\\\\dots,c_k\\\\), each of which already has \\\\(dp[c_i]\\\\).  In a perfect subtree of height \\\\(h\\\\) (so leaves at distance \\\\(h\\\\) from the root), one has exactly\\n   – \\\\(2^h\\\\) leaves (at depth \\\\(h\\\\)) and\\n   – a total of \\\\(\\\\sum_{d=1}^h 2^d = 2^{h+1}-2\\\\) non‐root nodes at depths \\\\(1,2,\\\\dots,h\\\\).\\n\\nYou must pick \\\\(k\\\\) distinct nodes in depths \\\\(1\\\\le d\\\\le h\\\\) to serve as the images of your \\\\(k\\\\) children, and each child \\\\(c_i\\\\) has “demand” \\\\(dp[c_i]\\\\), meaning\\n\\\\[d \\\\;\\\\le\\\\; h \\\\;-\\\\; dp[c_i],\\\\]\\nso that from that depth \\\\(d\\\\)-node you still have \\\\(dp[c_i]\\\\) levels below available.\\n\\nIt turns out that the only thing that matters is an **earliest‐deadline**-type check on those demands: if you sort the children by \\\\(dp[c_i]\\\\) **descending** (so the tightest demands first), and call them\\n\\\\[\\nw_1\\\\ge w_2\\\\ge \\\\cdots\\\\ge w_k,\\n\\\\]\\nthen for a candidate \\\\(h\\\\) you compute, for the \\\\(i\\\\)th child in this order, its latest allowed depth\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\mathrm{limit}_i \\\\;=\\\\; h \\\\;-\\\\; w_i\\n\\\\]\\nand you must be able to assign those \\\\(k\\\\) children into the \\\\(\\\\sum_{d=1}^h2^d\\\\) available depth-slots so that the \\\\(i\\\\)th child goes no deeper than \\\\(\\\\mathrm{limit}_i\\\\).  An Earliest‐Deadline‐First check shows that this is feasible if and only if for each \\\\(i\\\\)\\n\\\\[\\ni \\\\;\\\\;\\\\le\\\\;\\\\; \\\\sum_{d=1}^{\\\\mathrm{limit}_i}2^d\\n\\\\;=\\\\;2^{\\\\,\\\\mathrm{limit}_i+1}\\\\;-\\\\;2.\\n\\\\]\\nSince \\\\(k\\\\le10^6\\\\) but each perfect‐tree capacity \\\\(2^{d+1}-2\\\\) exceeds \\\\(10^6\\\\) once \\\\(d\\\\ge20\\\\), you only ever need to check limits \\\\(d\\\\le20\\\\).  Hence we can binary‐search the smallest \\\\(h\\\\) between\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\max_i(w_i+1)\\n\\\\quad\\\\text{and}\\\\quad\\n\\\\max_i(w_i+1)+20\\n\\\\]\\nand test EDF in \\\\(O(k)\\\\).  Summing over all \\\\(v\\\\) this is \\\\(O(n\\\\log n)\\\\) overall.\\n\\nBelow is a clean Java implementation.  We read in the tree in \\\\(O(n)\\\\), build a list of children per node, then process nodes in reverse input order (since each parent index is \\\\(<\\\\) child index, that guarantees children come before parents).  For each node we gather its children’s \\\\(dp\\\\)-values, sort descending, binary‐search \\\\(h\\\\), do the EDF check in up to 20 steps each requiring \\\\(O(\\\\text{degree}(v))\\\\).  Total is \\\\(O\\\\bigl(n\\\\log(\\\\max\\\\deg)\\\\bigr)\\\\approx O(n\\\\log n)\\\\), easily within the 3.5 s limit for \\\\(n\\\\!\\\\le10^6\\\\).\\n\\n```java\\nimport java.io.*;\\nimport java.util.*;\\n\\npublic class Main {\\n    static final int MAX_SMALL = 20; \\n    // We only need to check deadlines up to 20, since 2^(20+1)-2 > 1e6.\\n\\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\\n        // Fast I/O\\n        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));\\n        PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(System.out);\\n        String line = br.readLine();\\n        int t = Integer.parseInt(line.trim());\\n        \\n        // Precompute small capacities capSum[d] = sum_{i=1..d} 2^i = 2^{d+1}-2\\n        long[] capSum = new long[MAX_SMALL+1];\\n        for (int d = 0; d <= MAX_SMALL; d++) {\\n            capSum[d] = ((1L << (d+1)) - 2L);\\n            if (capSum[d] < 0) capSum[d] = Long.MAX_VALUE; \\n            // just in case shifting beyond 63 bits\\n        }\\n\\n        // Process each test case\\n        while (t-- > 0) {\\n            line = br.readLine();\\n            int n = Integer.parseInt(line.trim());\\n            // Read parents\\n            int[] parent = new int[n+1];\\n            String[] parts = br.readLine().trim().split(\\\"\\\\\\\\s+\\\");\\n            for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {\\n                parent[i] = Integer.parseInt(parts[i-2]);\\n            }\\n            // Build children adjacency\\n            ArrayList<Integer>[] children = new ArrayList[n+1];\\n            for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\\n                children[i] = new ArrayList<>();\\n            }\\n            for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {\\n                children[parent[i]].add(i);\\n            }\\n\\n            // dp[v] = minimal height h of a perfect subtree needed to host v's subtree.\\n            int[] dp = new int[n+1];\\n\\n            // Process nodes in reverse order  n, n-1, ..., 1\\n            // Since parent[i]<i, this guarantees all children of i are processed before i.\\n            for (int v = n; v >= 1; v--) {\\n                if (children[v].isEmpty()) {\\n                    // Leaf => no height needed\\n                    dp[v] = 0;\\n                } else {\\n                    int k = children[v].size();\\n                    // Gather children dps\\n                    int[] w = new int[k];\\n                    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {\\n                        w[i] = dp[ children[v].get(i) ];\\n                    }\\n                    // Sort descending\\n                    Arrays.sort(w);\\n                    // We'll read from the back\\n                    // w[k-1] highest, w[k-2] next, ... w[0] smallest\\n\\n                    // Lower bound on h is max w_i + 1\\n                    int wmax = w[k-1];\\n                    int lo = wmax + 1;\\n                    // Upper bound we only need + MAX_SMALL\\n                    int hi = lo + MAX_SMALL;\\n\\n                    // Binary‐search the minimal h in [lo..hi]\\n                    while (lo < hi) {\\n                        int mid = (lo + hi) >>> 1;\\n                        // EDF‐type check\\n                        boolean ok = true;\\n                        // We'll assign the \\\"i-th child in deadline order\\\" to check i <= capSum(limit_i)\\n                        // Our deadline array is limit_i = mid - w_i, and sorted so tightest (smallest limit) first => largest w first\\n                        // So i=1 => w[k-1], i=2 => w[k-2], ...\\n                        for (int i = 1; i <= k; i++) {\\n                            int wi = w[k - i]; \\n                            int lim = mid - wi;\\n                            if (lim < 1) {\\n                                ok = false;\\n                                break;\\n                            }\\n                            // Cap the limit to MAX_SMALL to index our array\\n                            if (lim > MAX_SMALL) lim = MAX_SMALL;\\n                            if ((long)i > capSum[lim]) {\\n                                ok = false;\\n                                break;\\n                            }\\n                        }\\n                        if (ok) {\\n                            hi = mid;\\n                        } else {\\n                            lo = mid + 1;\\n                        }\\n                    }\\n                    dp[v] = lo;\\n                }\\n            }\\n\\n            // The root's dp[1] is the answer\\n            out.println(dp[1]);\\n        }\\n\\n        out.flush();\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nExplanation:\\n\\n1.  We store the tree in a standard children‐list representation.  Since the input guarantees \\\\(p_i < i\\\\), simply processing \\\\(v\\\\) from \\\\(n\\\\) down to \\\\(1\\\\) ensures that by the time we do \\\\(v\\\\), all of its children have been handled.\\n\\n2.  We keep an array `dp[v]`, meaning “if I only had a perfect binary subtree of height `dp[v]` rooted at \\\\(v\\\\)’s image, I could contract inside it to realize exactly the subtree of the input under \\\\(v\\\\).”\\n\\n3.  If \\\\(v\\\\) is a leaf, clearly `dp[v]=0`.  \\n\\n4.  Otherwise, let its \\\\(k\\\\) children have already `dp` values \\\\(\\\\{w_i\\\\}\\\\).  We need to choose \\\\(k\\\\) *distinct* nodes in depths \\\\(1\\\\le d\\\\le h\\\\) (of a perfect subtree of height \\\\(h\\\\)) so that child-i’s `dp` is \\\\(\\\\le h-d\\\\).  Equivalently each child has a “latest allowed depth” \\\\(\\\\text{limit}_i=h-w_i\\\\).  \\n\\n5.  A well-known EDF (Earliest‐Deadline‐First) feasibility check says that you list the children in *increasing* order of those limits (i.e.\\\\ largest demand \\\\(w\\\\) first), and ensure that the \\\\(i\\\\)th child’s deadline \\\\(\\\\text{limit}_i\\\\) is still large enough to accommodate \\\\(i\\\\) total tasks:\\n   \\\\[\\n       i \\\\;\\\\le\\\\;\\\\sum_{d=1}^{\\\\text{limit}_i}2^d\\n       \\\\;=\\\\;2^{\\\\,\\\\text{limit}_i+1}\\\\;-\\\\;2.\\n   \\\\]\\n   Since we only ever need to check \\\\(\\\\text{limit}\\\\le20\\\\) (beyond that the capacity \\\\(2^{21}-2\\\\) already exceeds all possible \\\\(i\\\\le10^6\\\\)), we cap at 20 and do the check in \\\\(O(k)\\\\).\\n\\n6.  We binary‐search the minimal \\\\(h\\\\) from \\\\(\\\\max_i(w_i+1)\\\\) up to “that + 20,” each test \\\\(O(k)\\\\).  Summed over all nodes that stays \\\\(O(n\\\\log(\\\\max\\\\deg))\\\\), comfortably in time for \\\\(n\\\\le10^6\\\\).\\n\\nFinally we print `dp[1]`, the minimum perfect‐tree depth needed at the root.\\n\\nComplexity:\\n\\n-  Building the tree and reading input: \\\\(O(n)\\\\).\\n-  Each node \\\\(v\\\\) we sort its degree \\\\(k=\\\\deg(v)\\\\) dps in \\\\(O(k\\\\log k)\\\\), then do up to 20 binary‐search steps each \\\\(O(k)\\\\).  Summing over all \\\\(v\\\\), \\\\(\\\\sum k=n-1\\\\), so overall \\\\(O\\\\bigl(n\\\\log(\\\\max k)+n\\\\cdot20\\\\bigr)=O(n\\\\log n)\\\\).\\n-  Fits well under 3.5 seconds for \\\\(n\\\\) up to \\\\(10^6\\\\).\\n\\nThat completes the solution.\",\n        \"refusal\": null,\n        \"role\": \"assistant\",\n        \"annotations\": [],\n        \"audio\": null,\n        \"function_call\": null,\n        \"tool_calls\": null\n      },\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"protected_material_code\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"protected_material_text\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"created\": 1753326672,\n  \"model\": \"o4-mini-2025-04-16\",\n  \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n  \"service_tier\": null,\n  \"system_fingerprint\": null,\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"completion_tokens\": 26016,\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 1146,\n    \"total_tokens\": 27162,\n    \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n      \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"reasoning_tokens\": 23040,\n      \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n    },\n    \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"cached_tokens\": 0\n    }\n  },\n  \"prompt_filter_results\": [\n    {\n      \"prompt_index\": 0,\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"jailbreak\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
