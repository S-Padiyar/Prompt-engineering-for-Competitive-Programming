Smithing Skill\n\ntime limit per test3 seconds\n\nmemory limit per test256 megabytes\n\nYou are playing a famous computer game (that just works) where you have various skills you can level up. Today, you focused on the \"Smithing\" skill. Your tactic is obvious: forging weapons from ingots and then melting them back to return the materials partially. For simplicity, every time you create an item, you get 1\n\n experience point, and every time you melt an item, you also get 1\n\n experience point.\n\n\n\nThere are n\n\n classes of weapons you can forge and m\n\n types of metal ingots.\n\n\n\nYou can create one weapon of the i\n\n-th class, spending ai\n\n ingots of metal of the same type. Melting a weapon of the i\n\n-th class (which you crafted earlier) returns you bi\n\n ingots of the type of metal it was made of.\n\n\n\nYou have cj\n\n metal ingots of the j\n\n-th type, and you know that you can craft a weapon of any class from any metal type. Each combination of a weapon class and a metal type can be used any number of times.\n\n\n\nWhat is the maximum total amount of experience you can earn by crafting and melting weapons?\n\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n\n\n and m\n\n (1≤n,m≤106\n\n) — the number of weapon classes and metal types.\n\n\n\nThe second line contains n\n\n integers a1,a2,…,an\n\n (1≤ai≤106\n\n), where ai\n\n is the number of ingots you need to forge one weapon of the i\n\n-th class.\n\n\n\nThe third line contains n\n\n integers b1,b2,…,bn\n\n (0≤bi<ai\n\n), where bi\n\n is the number of ingots you return by melting one weapon of the i\n\n-th class you forged earlier.\n\n\n\nThe fourth line contains m\n\n integers c1,c2,…,cm\n\n (1≤cj≤109\n\n) — the number of ingots you have of the corresponding metal type.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nPrint one integer — the maximum total experience points you can gain by repeatedly forging and melting weapons.\n\n\n\nExamples\n\nInputCopy\n\n5 3\n\n9 6 7 5 5\n\n8 4 5 1 2\n\n10 4 7\n\nOutputCopy\n\n12\n\nInputCopy\n\n3 4\n\n10 20 20\n\n0 0 0\n\n9 10 19 20\n\nOutputCopy\n\n8\n\nInputCopy\n\n1 5\n\n3\n\n1\n\n1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000\n\nOutputCopy\n\n4999999990\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, you can do the following:\n\n\n\ncraft one weapon of the 1\n\n-st class from the 1\n\n-st type of metal, spending 9\n\n ingots;\n\nmelt that weapon, returning 8\n\n ingots of the 1\n\n-st metal type;\n\nagain, craft and melt one weapon of the 1\n\n-st class from the 1\n\n-st metal type;\n\ncraft and melt one weapon of the 3\n\n-rd class from the 1\n\n-st metal type;\n\ncraft and melt one weapon of the 3\n\n-rd class from the 3\n\n-rd metal type;\n\ncraft and melt one weapon of the 4\n\n-th class from the 1\n\n-st metal type;\n\ncraft and melt one weapon of the 5\n\n-th class from the 3\n\n-rd metal type;\n\nIn the end you'll have c=[2,4,2]\n\n ingots left. In total, you've crafted 6\n\n weapons and melted 6\n\n weapons, gaining 12\n\n experience points in total.\n\nUse Java."
