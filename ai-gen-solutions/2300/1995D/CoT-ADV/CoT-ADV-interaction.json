You know that\n\n\n\nIts words consist only of the first c\n\n letters of the Latin alphabet.\n\nEach word has a case which can be unambiguously determined by its last letter (different letters correspond to different cases). For example, words \"ABACABA\" and \"ABA\" (if they exist) have the same case in this language because they both have the same ending 'A', whereas \"ALICE\" and \"BOB\" have different cases. If the language does not have a case corresponding to some letter, it means that the word cannot end with this letter.\n\nThe length of each word is k\n\n or less.\n\nYou have a single text written in this language. Unfortunately, as the language is really ancient, spaces between words are missing and all letters are uppercase. You wonder what is the minimum number of cases the language can have. Can you find this out?\n\n\n\nInput\n\nEach test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single integer t\n\n (1≤t≤10000\n\n) — the number of test cases. It is followed by descriptions of the test cases.\n\n\n\nThe first line of each test case contains three integers n\n\n, c\n\n, k\n\n (1≤k≤n≤218\n\n, 1≤c≤18\n\n) — the length of the text, the number of letters in the language, and the maximum length of the word.\n\n\n\nThe second line contains a string of n\n\n characters — the text itself. Each character is one of the first c\n\n uppercase letters of the Latin alphabet.\n\n\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n\n\n over all test cases does not exceed 218\n\n and the sum of 2c\n\n over all test cases does not exceed 218\n\n.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single line consisting of a single integer — the minimum number of cases in the language.\n\n\n\nExample\n\nInputCopy\n\n7\n\n5 5 1\n\nABCDE\n\n3 1 2\n\nAAA\n\n3 2 2\n\nAAB\n\n10 2 2\n\nABABABABAB\n\n4 4 4\n\nDCBA\n\n1 17 1\n\nQ\n\n9 3 2\n\nABCABCABC\n\nOutputCopy\n\n5\n\n1\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, there must be five cases in the language (for each of the letters 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', and 'E' there must be a case that has a corresponding ending).\n\n\n\nIn the fourth test case, one case with ending 'B' is sufficient.\n\n---\n\nYou are a competitive programming assistant solving Codeforces problems using Java. First, carefully read and restate the problem in your own words to ensure full understanding. Identify the input and output formats, list the constraints, and consider any edge cases that might affect the logic. Next, determine which algorithmic pattern the problem fits best—such as greedy, binary search, two pointers, dynamic programming, or graph traversal—and briefly explain why that pattern applies. Then, plan your solution step by step, describing the key ideas, data structures, or mathematical insights you’ll use. Once your plan is clear, write a clean and fully working Java program. Use import java.util.*; and include a Main class with a main method, using Scanner or BufferedReader for input depending on the constraints. Add comments to explain important logic in the code. After coding, walk through a sample input manually to show how your solution works in practice. Finally, analyze the time and space complexity of your approach using Big-O notation, justifying your answer. Think step by step and only write code once the logic is sound and complete."

The ancient language's words can be at most *k* letters long, and each word's _case_ is determined by its last letter.  If the language does _not_ have a case for some letter X, then no word in the language may end in X.\\n\\nThe spaces between words have been lost, so the given string *s* must be segmentable into consecutive words, each of length ≤ *k*, in such a way that _every_ word ends in one of the letters for which the language _does_ have cases.\\n\\nWe must choose a subset *S* of the letters of minimal size (this size is our answer) such that:\\n\\n1. Every word in a valid segmentation ends in a letter of *S*.\\n2. Every word length ≤ *k*.\\n3. The segmentation covers the entire text (so in particular the last letter *s[n–1]* must belong to *S*).\\n\\nWe want the minimal possible |*S*|.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Key Observation and Reduction**\\n\\n- If we decide that the language has cases exactly for the set *S* of letters, then in any segmentation we may end a word at _any_ occurrence of a letter in *S_.  \\n- To cover the entire text in segments of length ≤ *k*, the _distance_ between consecutive segment-end positions cannot exceed *k*.  Concretely, if you look at the positions where the letter lies in *S*, those positions (plus a dummy \\\"0\\\" at the start) must never be more than *k* apart.\\n- Equivalently, there must be **no** run of length *k* in the text that contains _zero_ letters from *S_.  In other words, _every_ substring of length *k* must contain at least one letter from *S_.  (That enforces that you cannot go k positions without seeing a possible word-end.)\\n\\nThus our problem becomes:\\n\\n- We must pick a subset *S* of the *c* letters that:\\n  1. Always hits every contiguous window of length *k* in the text (so that no k-length block is free of an allowed ending letter).\\n  2. Contains the final letter of the text *s[n–1]* (so that the last word can end at the end).\\n- Minimize |*S*|.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Equivalent “Forbidden Window” Formulation via Complements**\\n\\nLet *U* be the complement of *S* (the letters for _which_ we have _no_ case).  Then requiring that _every_ window of length *k* has at least one letter from *S* is the same as saying:\\n\\n> _No_ window of length *k* is composed entirely of letters from *U*.\\n\\nSo to test whether a given *U* is valid:\\n\\n- For each contiguous window of length *k*, we take the set of distinct letters appearing in that window—call its bitmask `m`.  \\n- If `m` is a subset of *U* (i.e. `(m & ~U) == 0`), then that window is entirely forbidden letters, and *U* is invalid.\\n- Otherwise *U* is okay.\\n\\nWe also must ensure the last letter (say index `e`) is _not_ in *U*, because we do need `s[n–1] ∈ S`, so `e ∉ U`.\\n\\nWe want the _largest_ possible *U* (so that *S* = complement is as small as possible) under these constraints.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Algorithm**\\n\\n1. **Edge case**: if `n ≤ k`, then we can take the _entire_ text as one word, so we only need one case: whatever letter `s[n–1]` is.  Answer = 1.\\n\\n2. **Collect “window-masks”**  \\n   We slide a length-k window over the text.  There are `n–k+1` windows, each window contributes a mask `m` of which letters appear in that window.  We record in a boolean array `forbidden[m] = true` for each such mask `m`.\\n\\n3. **Mark invalid complements**  \\n   We want to mark all subsets `U` of `{0..c−1}` that _contain_ any of those window‐masks entirely.  In bit‐mask terms, we want to mark every `U` that has a subset `m` with `forbidden[m] == true`.  \\n   A standard “superset‐fill” trick:  \\n   - Initialize `bad[m] = forbidden[m]`.  \\n   - For each `bit` from 0 to `c−1`, for each mask `M`, if `M` has that `bit` set, then `bad[M] |= bad[M ^ (1<<bit)]`.  \\n   After this, `bad[U]` is true whenever `U` covers at least one forbidden mask.\\n\\n4. **Pick the largest valid U**  \\n   We iterate `U` from `0` to `(1<<c)–1`.  Keep only those with:\\n   - `bad[U] == false`  (no k-window is fully inside `U`)\\n   - `(U & (1<<e)) == 0` (the last‐letter index `e` is _not_ in `U`)\\n   Among those, take the maximum popcount(`U`).  Call it `bestU`.\\n\\n5. **Answer** = `c − bestU`.\\n\\nOverall complexity per test is `O(n + c·2^c)`, and constraints guarantee that across all tests ∑n ≤ 2^18 and ∑2^c ≤ 2^18, so it runs in a few million operations total.\\n\\n---\\n\\n```java\\nimport java.io.*;\\nimport java.util.*;\\n\\npublic class Main {\\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\\n        // Fast input\\n        BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));\\n        StringBuilder out = new StringBuilder();\\n\\n        int t = Integer.parseInt(in.readLine().trim());\\n        while (t-- > 0) {\\n            StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(in.readLine());\\n            int n = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\\n            int c = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\\n            int k = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\\n\\n            String s = in.readLine().trim();\\n            // If the whole text length <= k, we can make it one word, need only the last letter's case.\\n            if (n <= k) {\\n                out.append(1).append('\\\\n');\\n                continue;\\n            }\\n\\n            // Convert characters to 0..c-1\\n            int[] a = new int[n];\\n            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\\n                a[i] = s.charAt(i) - 'A';\\n            }\\n            int endIdx = a[n - 1];  // index of the final letter\\n\\n            int limit = 1 << c;\\n            // forbidden[M] = true if there's a k-length window whose set of letters = M\\n            boolean[] forbidden = new boolean[limit];\\n\\n            // Build the first window's letter counts\\n            int[] cnt = new int[c];\\n            int mask = 0;\\n            // first k letters\\n            for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {\\n                int x = a[i];\\n                if (cnt[x] == 0) {\\n                    mask |= (1 << x);\\n                }\\n                cnt[x]++;\\n            }\\n            // record the mask of window [0..k-1]\\n            forbidden[mask] = true;\\n            // slide the window from i=1..n-k\\n            for (int i = k; i < n; i++) {\\n                // remove a[i-k], add a[i]\\n                int outChar = a[i - k];\\n                cnt[outChar]--;\\n                if (cnt[outChar] == 0) {\\n                    mask &= ~(1 << outChar);\\n                }\\n                int inChar = a[i];\\n                if (cnt[inChar] == 0) {\\n                    mask |= (1 << inChar);\\n                }\\n                cnt[inChar]++;\\n                forbidden[mask] = true;\\n            }\\n\\n            // bad[U] = true if U contains any forbidden mask as a subset\\n            boolean[] bad = Arrays.copyOf(forbidden, limit);\\n            // superset DP: any superset of a bad set is also bad\\n            for (int bit = 0; bit < c; bit++) {\\n                for (int m = 0; m < limit; m++) {\\n                    if ((m & (1 << bit)) != 0 && bad[m ^ (1 << bit)]) {\\n                        bad[m] = true;\\n                    }\\n                }\\n            }\\n\\n            // Among complements U that are not bad and exclude the final letter,\\n            // pick the one with the largest popcount.\\n            int bestU = 0;\\n            for (int U = 0; U < limit; U++) {\\n                if (!bad[U] && ((U & (1 << endIdx)) == 0)) {\\n                    int pc = Integer.bitCount(U);\\n                    if (pc > bestU) {\\n                        bestU = pc;\\n                    }\\n                }\\n            }\\n\\n            // The answer is c - bestU (we choose S = complement of U)\\n            out.append((c - bestU)).append('\\\\n');\\n        }\\n\\n        // Print all answers\\n        System.out.print(out);\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Explanation of Key Steps**\\n\\n1. **Sliding-window masks**  \\n   We maintain a count of each of the *c* letters in the current window of length *k*, and a bitmask of which letters have nonzero count.  Every time the window moves one step to the right, we update counts and the mask in O(1).  We mark `forbidden[mask] = true` for each window.\\n\\n2. **Superset‐DP to mark bad complements**  \\n   We want any set *U* that contains (as a subset) a forbidden‐mask to be marked bad.  A classic technique: initialize `bad[m] = forbidden[m]`, then for each bit, for each mask, if `mask` has that bit, we `bad[mask] |= bad[mask ^ (1<<bit)]`.  This propagates \\\"badness\\\" upwards through supersets in O(c·2^c).\\n\\n3. **Selecting the final answer**  \\n   From all subsets *U* that are not `bad` and do _not_ include the final letter, we pick the one with the largest popcount.  Its complement has the minimal number of letters (cases) needed.\\n\\n---\\n\\nTime Complexity:\\n- Sliding-window: O(n).\\n- Superset DP: O(c · 2^c).\\n- Iteration to find best U: O(2^c).\\nSumming over all test cases stays within about 5 million operations (since ∑n ≤2^18 and ∑2^c ≤2^18), which is efficient for the time limits. \\n\\nSpace Complexity:\\n- O(2^c) for the `forbidden` and `bad` arrays (up to 2^18 boolean entries) plus O(n) for the input string.\",\n        \"refusal\": null,\n        \"role\": \"assistant\",\n        \"annotations\": [],\n        \"audio\": null,\n        \"function_call\": null,\n        \"tool_calls\": null\n      },\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"protected_material_code\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"protected_material_text\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"created\": 1753326635,\n  \"model\": \"o4-mini-2025-04-16\",\n  \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n  \"service_tier\": null,\n  \"system_fingerprint\": null,\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"completion_tokens\": 11975,\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 791,\n    \"total_tokens\": 12766,\n    \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n      \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"reasoning_tokens\": 9536,\n      \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n    },\n    \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"cached_tokens\": 0\n    }\n  },\n  \"prompt_filter_results\": [\n    {\n      \"prompt_index\": 0,\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"jailbreak\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
