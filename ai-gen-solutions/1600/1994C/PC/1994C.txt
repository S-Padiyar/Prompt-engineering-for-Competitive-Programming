Yaroslav is playing a computer game, and at one of the levels, he encountered n
 mushrooms arranged in a row. Each mushroom has its own level of toxicity; the i
-th mushroom from the beginning has a toxicity level of ai
. Yaroslav can choose two integers 1≤l≤r≤n
, and then his character will take turns from left to right to eat mushrooms from this subsegment one by one, i.e., the mushrooms with numbers l,l+1,l+2,…,r
.

The character has a toxicity level g
, initially equal to 0
. The computer game is defined by the number x
 — the maximum toxicity level at any given time. When eating a mushroom with toxicity level k
, the following happens:

The toxicity level of the character is increased by k
.
If g≤x
, the process continues; otherwise, g
 becomes zero and the process continues.
Yaroslav became interested in how many ways there are to choose the values of l
 and r
 such that the final value of g
 is not zero. Help Yaroslav find this number!

Input
Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
 (1≤t≤104
) — the number of test cases. Then follows the description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n
, x
 (1≤n≤2⋅105,1≤x≤109
) — the number of mushrooms and the maximum toxicity level.

The second line of each test case contains n
 numbers a1,a2,…,an
 (1≤ai≤109
).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n
 over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105
.

Output
For each test case, output a single number — the number of subsegments such that the final value of g
 will not be zero.

Note
In the first test case, the subsegments (1,1)
, (1,2)
, (1,4)
, (2,2)
, (2,3)
, (3,3)
, (3,4)
 and (4,4)
 are suitable.

In the second test case, non-zero g
 will remain only on the subsegments (1,1)
 and (2,2)
.

In the third test case, on the only possible subsegment, g
 will be zero.
