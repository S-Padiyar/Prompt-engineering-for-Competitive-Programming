In his favorite cafe Kmes once again wanted to try the herring under a fur coat. Previously, it would not have been difficult for him to do this, but the cafe recently introduced a new purchasing policy.

Now, in order to make a purchase, Kmes needs to solve the following problem: n
 cards with prices for different positions are laid out in front of him, on the i
-th card there is an integer ai
, among these prices there is no whole positive integer x
.

Kmes is asked to divide these cards into the minimum number of bad segments (so that each card belongs to exactly one segment). A segment is considered bad if it is impossible to select a subset of cards with a product equal to x
. All segments, in which Kmes will divide the cards, must be bad.

Formally, the segment (l,r)
 is bad if there are no indices i1<i2<…<ik
 such that l≤i1,ik≤r
, and ai1⋅ai2…⋅aik=x
.

Help Kmes determine the minimum number of bad segments in order to enjoy his favorite dish.

Input
The first line contains a single integer t
 (1≤t≤103
) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each set of input data gives you 2
 integers n
 and x
 (1≤n≤105,2≤x≤105
) — the number of cards and the integer, respectively.

The second line of each set of input data contains n
 integers ai
 (1≤ai≤2⋅105,ai≠x
) — the prices on the cards.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n
 over all sets of test data does not exceed 105
.

Output
For each set of input data, output the minimum number of bad segments.
