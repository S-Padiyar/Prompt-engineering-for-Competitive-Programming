Compute \\\\(\\\\gcd\\\\) of the entire array; call it \\\\(d\\\\).\\n2.  If \\\\(n=1\\\\), no operation is possible, so the array stays \\\\(\\\\{v\\\\}\\\\).  We directly compute the \\\\(k\\\\)-th missing from the set \\\\(\\\\{v\\\\}\\\\).\\n3.  If \\\\(n\\\\ge2\\\\), one can show by repeated subtract/add operations that one can eventually:\\n    - produce two copies of \\\\(d\\\\),  \\n    - subtract one from the other to get 0,  \\n    - and then by summing \\\\(d+0\\\\to d\\\\), \\\\(d+d\\\\to2d\\\\), etc., generate *any* multiple of \\\\(d\\\\).\\n\\n   Since we have \\\\(n\\\\) positions in the array, we can place exactly \\\\(n\\\\) distinct multiples of \\\\(d\\\\).  The best choice (to push all missing numbers as far right as possible) is to place\\n\\n       0, d, 2d, …, (n−1)d\\n\\n   in the final array (these are present).  **Every** other nonnegative integer is missing:\\n   - any integer not a multiple of \\\\(d\\\\) is obviously missing,  \\n   - multiples \\\\(\\\\ge n\\\\) (i.e.\\\\ \\\\(n\\\\,d,n\\\\,d+1,\\\\dots\\\\)) are missing.\\n\\n   We then enumerate the missing integers in increasing order in two phases:\\n\\n   a)  The “covered” blocks \\\\(t=0,1,\\\\dots,n-1\\\\), each block \\\\([t\\\\,d,(t+1)\\\\,d-1]\\\\) has exactly \\\\((d-1)\\\\) missing numbers  \\n       (all those that are not exactly the multiple \\\\(t\\\\,d\\\\)).\\n\\n   b)  The “tail” blocks \\\\(t=n,n+1,\\\\dots\\\\), each of size \\\\(d\\\\), all missing.\\n\\n   From simple arithmetic we deduce formulas for the \\\\(k\\\\)-th missing in either the first \\\\(n\\\\) blocks or in the tail.  \\n\\nThis solves the problem in \\\\(O(n)\\\\) per test (for the gcd & a few constant-time arithmetic steps), well within the \\\\(2\\\\) s/256 MB limits.\",\n        \"refusal\": null,\n        \"role\": \"assistant\",\n        \"annotations\": [],\n        \"audio\": null,\n        \"function_call\": null,\n        \"tool_calls\": null\n      },\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"protected_material_code\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"protected_material_text\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"created\": 1753309566,\n  \"model\": \"o4-mini-2025-04-16\",\n  \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n  \"service_tier\": null,\n  \"system_fingerprint\": null,\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"completion_tokens\": 9296,\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 466,\n    \"total_tokens\": 9762,\n    \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n      \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"reasoning_tokens\": 6848,\n      \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n    },\n    \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"cached_tokens\": 0\n    }\n  },\n  \"prompt_filter_results\": [\n    {\n      \"prompt_index\": 0,\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"jailbreak\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
