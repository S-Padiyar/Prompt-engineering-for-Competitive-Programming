**Analysis**

We have an array `a[1..n]` and a parameter `k`.  In one move we remove any *contiguous* block of exactly `k` elements.  We keep removing while the current size exceeds `k`.  When we stop, the remaining array has length

```
    L = n − T·k
```

where

```
    T = ⌈(n−k)/k⌉   (the minimum # of removals so that n − T·k ≤ k).
```

One can check algebraically that

```
    T = ⌊(n−1)/k⌋,
    L = n − T·k
```

and in fact

```
    L = (n mod k == 0 ? k : n mod k).
```

We want to choose *which* elements survive so as to maximize the median of the final array of length `L`.  It turns out (and can be shown by “gap-divisibility” arguments on the forced‐sizes of the removed blocks) that *any* valid choice of survivors corresponds precisely to picking exactly one element out of each of the first `L` residue‐classes modulo `k` (in the original 1-based indexing).  

Concretely:

- Label positions `1,2,…,n`.
- We must end up keeping exactly one element whose index ≡1 (mod k), one whose index ≡2 (mod k), …, up to one whose index ≡L (mod k).  
- Equivalently, for each `i=1..L` we pick exactly one `a[j]` with `j≡i (mod k)`.  

Since we wish the *median* of those `L` survivors to be as large as possible, in each residue class `i` we should pick the *maximum* value of `a[j]` among all `j≡i (mod k)`.  Call those maxima

```
   v[1] = max{ a[j] : j≡1 (mod k) },
   v[2] = max{ a[j] : j≡2 (mod k) },
   …,
   v[L] = max{ a[j] : j≡L (mod k) }.
```

Now sort the array `v[1..L]` in non‐decreasing order and take its median, i.e. the element at position

```
   m = ⌊(L+1)/2⌋
```

(1-based) in the sorted `v`.  That value is the answer.

This runs in O(n) to gather the class maxima plus O(L·log L) to sort (but \(\sum L \le \sum n\le5·10^5\)), so it is quite efficient.

**Explanation of the key step**

1.  After you remove \(T = \lfloor(n-1)/k\rfloor\) blocks of size \(k\), you are left with
   \[
     L = n - T\cdot k,
   \]
   and one can prove (by looking at the “gaps” of removed positions) that *exactly* one survivor must come from each of the first \(L\) residue‐classes modulo \(k\).  

2.  To maximize the final median, in each such class you simply pick the **maximum** array‐value available in that class.

3.  Finally, you have \(L\) chosen values, you sort them, and take the \(\big\lfloor\frac{L+1}2\big\rfloor\)-th one (1-based) to get the median.  

All steps run in \(O(n + L\log L)\le O(n\log n)\) over all test cases with \(\sum n\le5\cdot10^5\).
