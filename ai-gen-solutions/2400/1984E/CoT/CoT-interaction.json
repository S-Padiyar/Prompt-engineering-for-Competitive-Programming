Shuffle\n\ntime limit per test2 seconds\n\nmemory limit per test256 megabytes\n\nTwo hungry red pandas, Oscar and Lura, have a tree T\n\n with n\n\n nodes. They are willing to perform the following shuffle procedure on the whole tree T\n\n exactly once. With this shuffle procedure, they will create a new tree out of the nodes of the old tree.\n\n\n\nChoose any node V\n\n from the original tree T\n\n. Create a new tree T2\n\n, with V\n\n as the root.\n\nRemove V\n\n from T\n\n, such that the original tree is split into one or more subtrees (or zero subtrees, if V\n\n is the only node in T\n\n).\n\nShuffle each subtree with the same procedure (again choosing any node as the root), then connect all shuffled subtrees' roots back to V\n\n to finish constructing T2\n\n.\n\nAfter this, Oscar and Lura are left with a new tree T2\n\n. They can only eat leaves and are very hungry, so please find the maximum number of leaves over all trees that can be created in exactly one shuffle.\n\n\n\nNote that leaves are all nodes with degree 1\n\n. Thus, the root may be considered as a leaf if it has only one child.\n\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t\n\n (1≤t≤104\n\n) — the number of test cases.\n\n\n\nThe first line of every test case contains a single integer n\n\n (2≤n≤2⋅105\n\n) — the number of nodes within the original tree T\n\n.\n\n\n\nThe next n−1\n\n lines each contain two integers u\n\n and v\n\n (1≤u,v≤n\n\n) — an edge within the original tree T\n\n. The given edges form a tree.\n\n\n\nThe sum of n\n\n over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅105\n\n.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single integer — the maximum number of leaves achievable with exactly one shuffle procedure on the whole tree.\n\n\n\nExample\n\nInputCopy\n\n4\n\n5\n\n1 2\n\n1 3\n\n2 4\n\n2 5\n\n5\n\n1 2\n\n2 3\n\n3 4\n\n4 5\n\n6\n\n1 2\n\n1 3\n\n1 4\n\n1 5\n\n1 6\n\n10\n\n9 3\n\n8 1\n\n10 6\n\n8 5\n\n7 8\n\n4 6\n\n1 3\n\n10 1\n\n2 7\n\nOutputCopy\n\n4\n\n3\n\n5\n\n6\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, it can be shown that the maximum number of leaves is 4\n\n. To accomplish this, we can start our shuffle with selecting node 3\n\n as the new root.\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we are left only with one subtree, in which we can select node 2\n\n to be the new root of that subtree.\n\n\n\nThis will force all 3\n\n remaining nodes to be leaves, and once we connect them back to our new root, the shuffled subtree looks like this:\n\n\n\nWe connect the shuffled subtree back to our new root of our new tree. Our final tree has four leaves (including the root), and looks like this:\n\n\n\nIn our second test case, we have a line of five nodes. It can be shown that the maximum number of leaves after one shuffle is 3\n\n. We can start off with node 2\n\n, which forces node 1\n\n to become a leaf. Then, if we select node 4\n\n on the right side, we will also have nodes 3\n\n and 5\n\n as leaves.\n\n\n\nThe third test case is a star graph with six nodes. The number of leaves cannot increase, thus our answer will be 5\n\n (if we start the shuffling with the original root node).\n\n---\n\nLet's think step-by-step so we don't make mistakes. Use Java. Avoid syntax errors or infinite loops."

The “shuffle’’ procedure that the problem describes can be re‐interpreted in terms of **removal orders** and **acyclic orientations**:\\n\\n1.  We pick some vertex $v_1$ to be the root (it will be “removed’’ first).\\n2.  Removing $v_1$ splits $T$ into subtrees; in each subtree we pick a root $v_2$, remove it, etc., until all vertices are removed.  \\n3.  In the final shuffled tree, a vertex is a **leaf** exactly when at the moment it was removed it had no *yet‐unremoved* neighbors (except we get one extra leaf if the very first removed vertex $v_1$ has degree~1 in $T$).\\n\\nOne checks that\\n\\n-  Number a removal order $\\\\pi=(v_1,v_2,\\\\dots,v_n)$, and let \\n   \\n   \\\\[\\n     \\\\mathrm{deg}_{\\\\mathrm{rem}}(v_i)\\n     \\\\;=\\\\;\\n     \\\\#\\\\{\\\\,\\\\text{neighbors of }v_i\\\\text{ among }v_{i+1},\\\\dots,v_n\\\\}.\\n   \\\\]\\n   \\n-  A vertex $v_i\\\\,(i>1)$ becomes a leaf iff $\\\\mathrm{deg}_{\\\\mathrm{rem}}(v_i)=0\\\\,$, i.e.\\\\ it is removed **after** all its neighbors.  \\n-  The very first vertex $v_1$ contributes +1 leaf exactly if its original degree in $T$ was 1.\\n\\nIt turns out that “being removed after all of your neighbors’’ is exactly the condition of being a **sink** in the acyclic orientation induced by $\\\\pi$ (each edge is oriented from earlier‐removed to later‐removed).  One shows easily that the maximal number of sinks in a tree (under an acyclic orientation) is the size of a **maximum independent set** (MIS).  However, because the root $v_1$ is removed first, it cannot be one of those sinks—but if it is a **leaf** in $T$ (degree~1), it *still* contributes +1 by the special “root‐leaf’’ rule.  \\n\\nHence the answer is\\n\\\\[\\n   \\\\max_{\\\\substack{v_1\\\\in V\\\\\\\\\\\\deg_T(v_1)=1}}\\n     \\\\Bigl(1 + \\\\mathrm{MIS}\\\\bigl(T\\\\setminus\\\\{v_1\\\\}\\\\bigr)\\\\Bigr),\\n\\\\]\\nand one checks that removing any non‐leaf can never do better than removing some leaf.\\n\\n---\\n\\nSo our task:\\n\\n1.

In the post‐order we compute for each node $u$:\\n   - `down0[u]` = max size of an independent set in the subtree under $u$ *if* we **do not** include $u$.\\n   - `down1[u]` = max size of an independent set in the subtree under $u$ *if* we **do** include $u$ (then none of its children can be included).\\n\\n2. **Up‐DP**  \\n   We do a “rerooting’’ pass in pre‐order to compute the contributions from **above** each node.  Concretely, for each child $v$ of $u$, we set\\n   ```\\n     up0[v] = (skip‐total at u) − max(down0[v],down1[v])\\n     up1[v] = (take‐total at u) − down0[v]\\n   ```\\n   so that `up0[v]`/`up1[v]` represent how much MIS you get in the rest of the tree if you force $v$ out or in of the independent set.\\n\\n3. **Full Tree DP**  \\n   Once both “down’’ and “up'' are known, the full‐tree DP for each node $u$ is\\n   ```\\n     dp0tot[u] = ∑_{w∈adj[u]} max(contrib0(u←w),contrib1(u←w))\\n     dp1tot[u] = 1 + ∑_{w∈adj[u]} contrib0(u←w)\\n   ```\\n   where \\n   ```\\n    contrib0(u←child)=down0[child],  contrib1(u←child)=down1[child],\\n    contrib0(u←parent)=up0[u],       contrib1(u←parent)=up1[u].\\n   ```\\n\\n4. **Answer**  \\n   Finally we only need to pick which leaf $v₁$ we remove first (in the shuffle).  If $\\\\deg(v₁)=1$, removing it gives **+1** root‐leaf bonus, and the rest of the tree is a single component hanging off its neighbor $u$.  Its MIS is\\n   ```\\n      MIS(T\\\\v₁) = max(dp0tot[u]−1, dp1tot[u])\\n   ```\\n   but when you add `+1` for the root‐leaf, it becomes\\n   ```\\n       1 + max(dp0tot[u]−1, dp1tot[u])\\n     = max(dp0tot[u], dp1tot[u] + 1).\\n   ```\\n   We scan all leaves and take the maximum.\\n\\nThis runs in linear time per test, so overall $O\\\\bigl(\\\\sum n\\\\bigr)\\\\le3\\\\times10^5\\\\,$, which is comfortably fast under the 2 s limit.\",\n        \"refusal\": null,\n        \"role\": \"assistant\",\n        \"annotations\": [],\n        \"audio\": null,\n        \"function_call\": null,\n        \"tool_calls\": null\n      },\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"protected_material_code\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": true,\n          \"citation\": {\n            \"URL\": \"https://github.com/dks301/BOJ/tree/a2588b4b406a050e5c833fadb42589611cbff323/src%2FmyPackage%2FBOJ2533.java\",\n            \"license\": \"NOASSERTION\"\n          }\n        },\n        \"protected_material_text\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"created\": 1753311123,\n  \"model\": \"o4-mini-2025-04-16\",\n  \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n  \"service_tier\": null,\n  \"system_fingerprint\": null,\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"completion_tokens\": 25293,\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 804,\n    \"total_tokens\": 26097,\n    \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n      \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"reasoning_tokens\": 22144,\n      \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n    },\n    \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"cached_tokens\": 0\n    }\n  },\n  \"prompt_filter_results\": [\n    {\n      \"prompt_index\": 0,\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"jailbreak\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
