Hence for \\\\(k\\\\le2\\\\), once the count check passes, the answer is YES.\\n\\n-  For \\\\(k\\\\ge3\\\\), one must enforce a subtle global condition: if you ever form a 2-cross‐edge cycle\\n   \\\\[\\n     u\\\\;\\\\xrightarrow{\\\\;\\\\text{new}\\\\;}\\\\;p\\\\;\\\\longrightarrow^*\\\\;v\\\\;\\\\xrightarrow{\\\\;\\\\text{new}\\\\;}\\\\;t\\\\;\\\\longrightarrow^*\\\\;u\\n   \\\\]\\n   with one new edge \\\\(u\\\\to p\\\\) in \\\\(G_1\\\\to G_2\\\\) and one new edge \\\\(v\\\\to t\\\\) in \\\\(G_2\\\\to G_1\\\\), the total length of that cycle is \\\\(2\\\\) plus lengths of the two internal paths.  Since each internal path is already a multiple of \\\\(k\\\\), we get the cycle‐length \\\\(\\\\equiv 2\\\\pmod{k}\\\\), which is forbidden unless \\\\(2\\\\equiv 0\\\\pmod{k}\\\\).  And for \\\\(k\\\\ge3\\\\), \\\\(2\\\\not\\\\equiv0\\\\pmod{k}\\\\).  \\n\\n  It turns out that this \\\"no bad 2-cross-edge cycle\\\" requirement forces **all** of the new edges in \\\\(G_1\\\\to G_2\\\\) to respect the same \\\"shift\\\" of the internal \\\\(k\\\\)–periods of \\\\(G_1\\\\) vs.\\\\ \\\\(G_2\\\\), and similarly all of the new edges in \\\\(G_2\\\\to G_1\\\\) must respect another single shift.

Since each graph is strongly connected and every cycle‐length is a multiple of \\\\(k\\\\), it carries a well-defined “residue label” in \\\\(\\\\{0,1,\\\\dots,k-1\\\\}\\\\).

Call the two labelings \\\\(\\\\ell_1(\\\\cdot)\\\\) on \\\\(G_1\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\ell_2(\\\\cdot)\\\\) on \\\\(G_2\\\\).\\n\\n  2.

Thus for \\\\(k\\\\ge3\\\\) the problem reduces to **two** cyclic histogram-matching problems:\\n     -  Find all shifts \\\\(C\\\\) so that\\n        \\\\(\\\\;H_{1,\\\\rm out}[r] = H_{2,\\\\rm in}[(r+C)\\\\bmod k]\\\\) for all \\\\(r\\\\).\\n     -  Find all shifts \\\\(C\\\\) so that\\n        \\\\(\\\\;H_{1,\\\\rm in}[r]  = H_{2,\\\\rm out}[(r+C+2)\\\\bmod k]\\\\) for all \\\\(r\\\\).\\n\\n     If there is a common shift \\\\(C\\\\) satisfying both, the answer is YES; otherwise NO.\\n\\n  Both cyclic‐shift histogram checks can be done in \\\\(O(k)\\\\) time by rolling‐array or a 1D KMP on integer arrays of length \\\\(k\\\\).

Hence once the count‐check passes, the answer is **YES**.\\n\\n3. **Labeling the graphs mod \\\\(k\\\\)**  \\n   Since each graph is strongly connected and all directed cycles have length \\\\(\\\\equiv0\\\\pmod{k}\\\\), one can do a BFS from an arbitrary root in each graph and assign each vertex \\\\(v\\\\) a label \\\\(\\\\ell(v)\\\\in\\\\{0,1,\\\\dots,k-1\\\\}\\\\) so that every directed edge \\\\(u\\\\to v\\\\) satisfies\\n   \\\\[\\n     \\\\ell(v)\\\\;=\\\\;(\\\\ell(u)+1)\\\\bmod k.\\n   \\\\]\\n   The BFS is guaranteed consistent because any cycle in the graph has length \\\\(\\\\equiv0\\\\pmod{k}\\\\).\\n\\n4. **Histogram‐shift conditions**  \\n   Call\\n   \\\\[\\n     H_{1,\\\\rm out}[r]\\\\;=\\\\#\\\\{\\\\,u\\\\in O_1:\\\\ell_1(u)=r\\\\},\\\\quad\\n     H_{2,\\\\rm in}[r]\\\\;=\\\\#\\\\{\\\\,p\\\\in I_2:\\\\ell_2(p)=r\\\\},\\n   \\\\]\\n   and similarly \\\\(H_{1,\\\\rm in},H_{2,\\\\rm out}\\\\).  A simple cycle‐length check shows that **all** new edges \\\\(u\\\\to p\\\\) from \\\\(G_1\\\\to G_2\\\\) must carry the **same** shift\\n   \\\\(\\\\ell_2(p)\\\\equiv\\\\ell_1(u)+C\\\\pmod{k}\\\\).  Equating histograms gives\\n   \\\\[\\n     H_{1,\\\\rm out}[r] \\\\;=\\\\; H_{2,\\\\rm in}[(r+C)\\\\bmod k],\\n     \\\\quad r=0,1,\\\\dots,k-1.\\n   \\\\]\\n   A similar argument forces the edges \\\\(G_2\\\\to G_1\\\\) all to use the same shift \\\\(C+2\\\\).  Hence we need a single \\\\(C\\\\) that simultaneously satisfies\\n   \\\\[\\n     H_{1,\\\\rm out}[r] = H_{2,\\\\rm in}[(r+C)\\\\bmod k],\\n     \\\\quad\\n     H_{1,\\\\rm in}[r]  = H_{2,\\\\rm out}[(r+C+2)\\\\bmod k].\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n5. **Cyclic‐shift matching by KMP**  \\n   Each condition is a \\\"histogram of length \\\\(k\\\\) must match another histogram cyclically shifted by \\\\(C\\\\)\\\".  One does that in \\\\(O(k)\\\\) by concatenating the target histogram to itself (forming a length \\\\(2k\\\\) array) and running KMP to find all starting positions \\\\(<k\\\\) that match the pattern histogram.  Then we intersect the two sets of possible shifts.  If there is at least one shift common to both histogram‐matches, the answer is **YES**, else **NO**.\\n\\nThe entire solution runs in \\\\(O(n+m+ k)\\\\) per test, summing to under the given limits.\",\n        \"refusal\": null,\n        \"role\": \"assistant\",\n        \"annotations\": [],\n        \"audio\": null,\n        \"function_call\": null,\n        \"tool_calls\": null\n      },\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"protected_material_code\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": true,\n          \"citation\": {\n            \"URL\": \"https://github.com/chinh7/TC/tree/eacf6d40a53bca1209eb7b587b369bf6db70e649/src%2Fcodechef%2FBar.java\",\n            \"license\": \"NOASSERTION\"\n          }\n        },\n        \"protected_material_text\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"created\": 1753310959,\n  \"model\": \"o4-mini-2025-04-16\",\n  \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n  \"service_tier\": null,\n  \"system_fingerprint\": null,\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"completion_tokens\": 13295,\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 1135,\n    \"total_tokens\": 14430,\n    \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n      \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"reasoning_tokens\": 9280,\n      \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n    },\n    \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"cached_tokens\": 0\n    }\n  },\n  \"prompt_filter_results\": [\n    {\n      \"prompt_index\": 0,\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"jailbreak\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
