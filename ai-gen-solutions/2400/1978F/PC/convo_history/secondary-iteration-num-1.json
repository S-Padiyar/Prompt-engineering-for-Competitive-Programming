    "content": "**Analysis**\n\nWe have an \\(n\\times n\\) matrix \\(B\\) built by taking the input array \n\\[\nA = [\\,a_1,a_2,\\dots,a_n\\,]\n\\]\nand cyclically shifting it by one position in each row.  One then builds a graph on the \\(n^2\\) entries \\((i,j)\\) of \\(B\\), with an edge between \\((i_1,j_1)\\) and \\((i_2,j_2)\\) if\n\n1. \\(\\lvert i_1 - i_2\\rvert + \\lvert j_1 - j_2\\rvert \\le k\\),  \n2. \\(\\gcd\\bigl(B_{i_1,j_1},\\,B_{i_2,j_2}\\bigr) > 1\\).\n\nWe want the number of connected components of this graph.\n\nA key insight is that each diagonal (modulo \\(n\\)) of \\(B\\) has the *same* value from the original array \\(A\\).  Indeed, one checks that\n\\[\nB_{i,j} \\;=\\; a_{\\,\\bigl((j - i)\\bmod n\\bigr) + 1},\n\\]\nso all entries with the same \\((j-i)\\bmod n\\) come from the same single \\(a_t\\).  Call those *diagonal indices* \\(d=0,1,\\dots,n-1\\).  \n\nMoreover, within a single diagonal the vertices \\((i,j)\\) form a one‐dimensional chain with “Manhattan‐distance” edges (since \\(k\\ge2\\), each diagonal alone is a connected path).  The only way to connect *different* diagonals \\(d\\) and \\(d'\\) is via pairs of entries whose diagonal‐indices differ by at most \\(k\\) and whose values share a nontrivial common prime.\n\nOne can show that *all* edges in the big \\(n^2\\)-vertex graph reduce to edges between entire diagonals \\(d\\) and \\(d'\\) whenever\n\n- \\(\\lvert d - d'\\rvert \\le k\\), and\n- \\(\\gcd(a_{d+1},\\,a_{d'+1})>1\\).\n\nThus the problem collapses to a 1D union–find on the array indices \\(1,2,\\dots,n\\).  We create a disjoint–set (union–find) of size \\(n\\), and for every prime \\(p\\) we look at the positions \\(i\\) where \\(p\\mid a_i\\).  Suppose those positions are\n\\[\ni_1 < i_2 < \\cdots < i_m.\n\\]\nThen whenever \\(i_{t+1}-i_t\\le k\\) (which is exactly the condition \\(\\lvert d-d'\\rvert\\le k\\) for those two indices), we union them.  Finally the number of connected components is simply the number of distinct union–find roots.\n\nBecause \\(n\\) can be up to \\(10^6\\) (summed over all test cases) and \\(a_i\\le10^6\\), we\n\n1. Precompute the smallest‐prime‐factor array `spf[]` up to \\(10^6\\) by a linear sieve.\n2. For each test case, we initialize a union–find of size \\(n\\).\n3. We keep an integer array `lastPos[p]` (size up to \\(10^6\\)) that remembers the *last* index \\(i\\) at which the prime \\(p\\) appeared.  We also keep a list `usedPrimes` of the primes that actually occur in this test, so we can reset only those entries of `lastPos` afterwards.\n4. We walk through \\(i=1\\ldots n\\), factor \\(a_i\\) into its distinct prime‐factors via `spf[]`, and for each prime \\(p\\) we see if `lastPos[p]>0` and \\((i - \\text{lastPos}[p])\\le k\\).  If so, we union(\\(i\\), `lastPos[p]`).  Then we set `lastPos[p]=i`.\n5. At the end we count how many \\(i\\) are their own root in the union–find — that is the number of connected components.\n6. Finally we clear the used entries of `lastPos` and reuse the data structures for the next test.\n\nThis runs in roughly \\(O\\bigl(\\sum n\\log a_i\\bigr)\\) for the factorizations plus \\(\\sum n\\alpha(n)\\) for the union–find, which is perfectly fine for \\(\\sum n\\le10^6\\).  The memory is \\(O(\\max a)\\) for the sieve plus \\(O(\\max n)\\) for union–find.\n\n----\n\n```java\nimport java.io.*;\nimport java.util.*;\n\npublic class Main {\n    static final int MAXA = 1_000_000;\n    // spf[x] = smallest prime factor of x\n    static int[] spf = new int[MAXA + 1];\n\n    // Build smallest-prime-factor sieve in O(MAXA)\n    static void buildSieve() {\n        for (int i = 2; i <= MAXA; i++) {\n            if (spf[i] == 0) {\n                // i is prime\n                for (long j = i; j <= MAXA; j += i) {\n                    if (spf[(int) j] == 0) {\n                        spf[(int) j] = i;\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Union-Find / Disjoint Set\n    static int[] parent, rank;\n    static int find(int x) {\n        if (parent[x] != x) {\n            parent[x] = find(parent[x]);\n        }\n        return parent[x];\n    }\n    static void union(int a, int b) {\n        a = find(a);\n        b = find(b);\n        if (a == b) return;\n        // union by rank\n        if (rank[a] < rank[b]) {\n            parent[a] = b;\n        } else if (rank[b] < rank[a]) {\n            parent[b] = a;\n        } else {\n            parent[b] = a;\n            rank[a]++;\n        }\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\n        buildSieve();\n\n        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));\n        PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(new BufferedWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(System.out)));\n\n        int t = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine().trim());\n\n        // lastPos[p] = last index i where prime p was seen in current test\n        // 0 means \"not seen yet\"\n        int[] lastPos = new int[MAXA + 1];\n        // We'll keep track of which primes we actually used,\n        // so we can reset only those entries in lastPos.\n        ArrayList<Integer> usedPrimes = new ArrayList<>();\n\n        while (t-- > 0) {\n            StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\n            int n = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\n            int k = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\n            st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\n            int[] a = new int[n+1];\n            for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n                a[i] = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\n            }\n\n            // Initialize union-find\n            parent = new int[n+1];\n            rank   = new int[n+1];\n            for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n                parent[i] = i;\n                rank[i]   = 0;\n            }\n\n            usedPrimes.clear();\n\n            // Sweep over the array indices\n            for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n                int x = a[i];\n                // Factor x via spf[], collecting distinct primes\n                int lastP = -1;\n                while (x > 1) {\n                    int p = spf[x];\n                    if (p != lastP) {\n                        if (lastPos[p] == 0) {\n                            // first time seeing prime p in this test\n                            usedPrimes.add(p);\n                        } else {\n                            int prevI = lastPos[p];\n                            // if within distance k in the diagonal-sense we union\n                            if (i - prevI <= k) {\n                                union(i, prevI);\n                            }\n                        }\n                        lastPos[p] = i;\n                        lastP = p;\n                    }\n                    x /= p;\n                }\n            }\n\n            // Count distinct roots => number of connected components\n            int comps = 0;\n            for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n                if (find(i) == i) comps++;\n            }\n            pw.println(comps);\n\n            // Reset lastPos for the primes we used\n            for (int p : usedPrimes) {\n                lastPos[p] = 0;\n            }\n        }\n\n        pw.flush();\n        pw.close();\n        br.close();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation of the Key Steps**\n\n1. **Smallest‐Prime‐Factor sieve**  \n   We build an array `spf[]` so that `spf[x]` gives the smallest prime that divides \\(x\\).  This is done in \\(O(\\max A)\\) time by a modified sieve.\n\n2. **Union–Find setup**  \n   We create a union–find (disjoint–set) of size \\(n\\) (one element per diagonal).  Initially each index is its own parent.\n\n3. **“Last‐seen” array for primes**  \n   We keep `lastPos[p]` = the last index \\(i\\) where prime \\(p\\) divided \\(a_i\\).  If at some later index \\(j\\) prime \\(p\\) again divides \\(a_j\\) and \\(j - i \\le k\\), we union \\(i\\) and \\(j\\).  \n\n4. **Why only “consecutive” by prime is enough**  \n   Suppose a prime \\(p\\) divides at indices\n   \\[\n     i_1 < i_2 < \\cdots < i_m.\n   \\]\n   We only need to consider edges \\((i_t,i_{t+1})\\) whenever \\(i_{t+1}-i_t\\le k\\).  Any two farther‐apart by \\(\\le k\\) will be connected by a chain of such consecutive unions.\n\n5. **Answer**  \n   After processing all primes, we count how many distinct union–find roots remain; that is the number of connected components.\n\nThis runs in \\(O\\bigl((\\sum n)\\log A + (\\sum n)\\,\\alpha(n)\\bigr)\\), which easily fits under the time limits for \\(\\sum n\\le 10^6\\)."
