Maximize the Largest Component (Hard Version)\n\ntime limit per test2 seconds\n\nmemory limit per test512 megabytes\n\nEasy and hard versions are actually different problems, so read statements of both problems completely and carefully. The only difference between the two versions is the operation.\n\n\n\nAlex has a grid with n\n\n rows and m\n\n columns consisting of '.' and '#' characters. A set of '#' cells forms a connected component if from any cell in this set, it is possible to reach any other cell in this set by only moving to another cell in the set that shares a common side. The size of a connected component is the number of cells in the set.\n\n\n\nIn one operation, Alex selects any row r\n\n (1≤r≤n\n\n) and any column c\n\n (1≤c≤m\n\n), then sets every cell in row r\n\n and column c\n\n to be '#'. Help Alex find the maximum possible size of the largest connected component of '#' cells that he can achieve after performing the operation at most once.\n\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer t\n\n (1≤t≤104\n\n) — the number of test cases.\n\n\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers n\n\n and m\n\n (1≤n⋅m≤106\n\n) — the number of rows and columns of the grid.\n\n\n\nThe next n\n\n lines each contain m\n\n characters.

First, carefully read and restate the problem in your own words to ensure full understanding. Identify the input and output formats, list the constraints, and consider any edge cases that might affect the logic. Next, determine which algorithmic pattern the problem fits best—such as greedy, binary search, two pointers, dynamic programming, or graph traversal—and briefly explain why that pattern applies. Then, plan your solution step by step, describing the key ideas, data structures, or mathematical insights you’ll use. Once your plan is clear, write a clean and fully working Java program. Use import java.util.*; and include a Main class with a main method, using Scanner or BufferedReader for input depending on the constraints. Add comments to explain important logic in the code. After coding, walk through a sample input manually to show how your solution works in practice. Finally, analyze the time and space complexity of your approach using Big-O notation, justifying your answer. Think step by step and only write code once the logic is sound and complete."

A **connected component** of ‘\\\\#’‐cells is a maximal set of ‘\\\\#’ cells in which you can move between any two cells by stepping only to orthogonally adjacent ‘\\\\#’ cells (up/down/left/right).  Its **size** is the number of ‘\\\\#’ cells in it.\\n\\nWe are allowed to perform **at most one operation**: pick a row \\\\(r\\\\) and a column \\\\(c\\\\), and turn **every** cell in that row and that column into ‘\\\\#’ (overwriting whatever was there).  After that operation, the grid’s connected components change (some old components may merge, and the new “cross” of \\\\(r\\\\) and \\\\(c\\\\) itself is a component).  We want to choose the operation (or choose to do nothing) so that **the largest** connected‐component size of ‘\\\\#’‐cells **after** the operation is as large as possible.  Output that maximum possible size.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Input**\\n\\nt            — number of test cases (up to \\\\(10^4\\\\));  \\nFor each test case:  \\n\\\\ \\\\ n, m     — dimensions, with \\\\(1 \\\\le n\\\\cdot m \\\\le 10^6\\\\).  \\n\\\\ \\\\ next \\\\(n\\\\) lines each contain an \\\\(m\\\\)-character string of ‘\\\\#’/‘.’.\\n\\n**Output**\\n\\nFor each test case, one integer: the maximum possible size of the largest ‘\\\\#’ connected component after at most one operation.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Constraints & Edge Cases**\\n\\n• The total grid area over all test cases is at most \\\\(10^6\\\\), so an \\\\(O(nm)\\\\)-time solution per test case (or overall) is required.  \\n• We must consider the case of doing **no** operation (so the answer is at least the size of the largest original component).  \\n• If the grid is entirely ‘.’, a single operation will create a cross of size \\\\((n + m - 1)\\\\).  \\n• Small grids (including \\\\(1\\\\times1\\\\)) must work correctly.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**High‐Level Solution Sketch**\\n\\n1. **Label and measure original components**  \\n   - Do a standard BFS/DFS to label each connected component of ‘\\\\#’ in the original grid.  \\n   - For each component \\\\(i\\\\), record:  \\n     • `size[i]` = number of cells  \\n     • `minRow[i], maxRow[i]` = minimum and maximum row it occupies  \\n     • `minCol[i], maxCol[i]` = minimum and maximum column it occupies  \\n   - Track `origMax` = size of the largest original component (in case we choose to do no operation).\\n\\n2. **Determine where each component would “touch” if we fill a row/column**  \\n   - If we select row \\\\(r\\\\), then any original component that has any cell in row \\\\(\\\\{r-1,\\\\,r,\\\\,r+1\\\\}\\\\) will become joined (via vertical adjacency) to the new “cross.”  Thus each component \\\\(i\\\\) has a **row‐adjacency interval**  \\n        \\\\[ R_i = [\\\\,\\\\max(1,\\\\minRow[i]-1)\\\\,,\\\\,\\\\min(n,\\\\maxRow[i]+1)\\\\,] .\\\\]  \\n   - Similarly, if we select column \\\\(c\\\\), the component touches \\\\(\\\\{c-1,c,c+1\\\\}\\\\).

For the best pair \\\\((4,2)\\\\) we get\\n   - `constantCross = 5+5−1 = 9`\\n   - `rowSum[4]` includes the sizes of all components that lie in rows 3–5\\n   - `colSum[2]` includes those in cols 1–3\\n   - subtract the 2D overlap (those counted in both)\\n   - subtract the original hashes in row 4 and column 2  \\n   This correctly yields a merged component size of 16, matching the sample.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Complexity Analysis**\\n\\n- Labeling components by BFS/DFS: \\\\(O(nm)\\\\).  \\n- Building difference updates: \\\\(O(\\\\#\\\\text{components}) \\\\le O(nm)\\\\).  \\n- 1D and 2D prefix sums: \\\\(O(nm)\\\\).  \\n- Final double loop over all \\\\((r,c)\\\\): \\\\(O(nm)\\\\).  \\n\\nOverall, \\\\(O(nm)\\\\) time per test case, and since \\\\(\\\\sum nm \\\\le 10^6\\\\), it runs well within the 2 s limit. Memory is dominated by a few \\\\(n\\\\times m\\\\) arrays and per-component data, also within 512 MB.\",\n        \"refusal\": null,\n        \"role\": \"assistant\",\n        \"annotations\": [],\n        \"audio\": null,\n        \"function_call\": null,\n        \"tool_calls\": null\n      },\n      \"content_filter_result\": {\n        \"error\": {\n          \"code\": \"content_filter_error\",\n          \"message\": \"The contents are not filtered\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"protected_material_code\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": true,\n          \"citation\": {\n            \"URL\": \"https://github.com/yesfordev/Algorithm/tree/86f2d7bf7e9f3a1e8df17683f2bf60a4a8b6faa2/baekjoon_java%2FBOJ_Silver_7576_%ED%86%A0%EB%A7%88%ED%86%A0.java\",\n            \"license\": \"NOASSERTION\"\n          }\n        },\n        \"protected_material_text\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"created\": 1753326687,\n  \"model\": \"o4-mini-2025-04-16\",\n  \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n  \"service_tier\": null,\n  \"system_fingerprint\": null,\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"completion_tokens\": 9632,\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 797,\n    \"total_tokens\": 10429,\n    \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n      \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"reasoning_tokens\": 5952,\n      \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n    },\n    \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"cached_tokens\": 0\n    }\n  },\n  \"prompt_filter_results\": [\n    {\n      \"prompt_index\": 0,\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"jailbreak\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
