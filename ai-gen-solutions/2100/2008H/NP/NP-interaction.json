In one query we are allowed to repeatedly subtract x from any element that is at least x;  in effect each element \\\\(a_i\\\\) can end up anywhere in the set\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\{\\\\,a_i - kx\\\\mid k=0,1,2,\\\\dots,\\\\lfloor a_i/x\\\\rfloor\\\\}.\\n\\\\]\\nIn particular the _minimum_ value to which \\\\(a_i\\\\) can be driven is\\n\\\\[\\na_i\\\\bmod x.\\n\\\\]\\nSince we want to **minimize the median** of the final array, it is always optimal to reduce every element as far as possible.  Hence the resulting array will be\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\bigl(a_1\\\\bmod x,\\\\;a_2\\\\bmod x,\\\\;\\\\dots,\\\\;a_n\\\\bmod x\\\\bigr),\\n\\\\]\\nand the answer to the query is simply the median of those remainders.  (Here the median is the \\\\(\\\\lfloor(n+2)/2\\\\rfloor\\\\)-th smallest if we index from 1.)\\n\\nA brute force solution for each query \\\\(x\\\\) would recompute all \\\\(a_i\\\\bmod x\\\\) and then select the median, costing \\\\(O(n)\\\\) per query.  With up to \\\\(10^5\\\\) queries and \\\\(n\\\\) up to \\\\(10^5\\\\), this is too slow (\\\\(10^{10}\\\\) operations in the worst case).\\n\\nInstead we split the queries into\\n\\n 1. **“Small”** \\\\(x\\\\), say \\\\(x\\\\le T\\\\),  \\n 2. **“Large”** \\\\(x\\\\), \\\\(x>T\\\\),\\n\\nwhere \\\\(T\\\\) is chosen around \\\\(\\\\sqrt n\\\\) (in the final code we use \\\\(T=1200\\\\)).\\n\\n–  For small \\\\(x\\\\), there are at most \\\\(T\\\\) distinct such queries.  We precompute\\n   \\\\[\\n   f_r \\\\;=\\\\;\\\\#\\\\{\\\\,i : a_i \\\\bmod x = r\\\\},\\\\quad r=0,1,2,\\\\dots,x-1,\\n   \\\\]\\n   by a single pass over the _unique_ values of \\\\(a_i\\\\).  That costs \\\\(O(n)\\\\) per small \\\\(x\\\\), and since there are at most \\\\(T\\\\) of them, the total is \\\\(O(Tn)\\\\).\\n\\n–  For large \\\\(x\\\\), the division into classes modulo \\\\(x\\\\) has very few “blocks,” namely \\n   \\\\(\\\\lfloor\\\\max(a_i)/x\\\\rfloor+1 \\\\le n/x +1\\\\approx n/T\\\\).  We do a small binary–search on the remainder\\n   \\\\(r\\\\in[0,x-1]\\\\) to find the smallest \\\\(r\\\\) whose prefix–count\\n   \\\\(\\\\#\\\\{\\\\,i : a_i\\\\bmod x\\\\le r\\\\}\\\\)\\n   is at least the median position.  Each such prefix–count can be computed in \\\\(O(n/x)\\\\) by using a global prefix–sum of the original frequencies of the \\\\(a_i\\\\).  A binary search costs \\\\(O(\\\\log x)\\\\) steps, each step \\\\(O(n/x)\\\\), so about \\\\(O((n/x)\\\\log x)\\\\).  Since for large \\\\(x\\\\), \\\\(n/x\\\\) is small (at most \\\\(n/T\\\\)), the total over all distinct large \\\\(x\\\\) stays around \\\\(O\\\\bigl(q\\\\,\\\\tfrac nT\\\\log n\\\\bigr)\\\\), which with \\\\(T\\\\approx\\\\sqrt n\\\\) is about \\\\(O(q\\\\sqrt n\\\\log n)\\\\).  \\n\\nIn practice with \\\\(n\\\\le10^5\\\\), \\\\(q\\\\le10^5\\\\), \\\\(T=1200\\\\) this runs comfortably in time.\\n\\nBelow is a Java implementation using these ideas.\\n\\n```java\\nimport java.io.*;\\nimport java.util.*;\\n\\npublic class Main {\\n    static final int SMALL = 1200;

Hence the final array is \\\\(\\\\{\\\\,a_i\\\\bmod x\\\\}\\\\), and the answer is just the median of those modded values.\\n\\n2. **Splitting \\\"small\\\" vs. \\\"large\\\" \\\\(x\\\\)**  \\n   - If \\\\(x\\\\le SM\\\\!ALL\\\\), we may have up to \\\\(SM\\\\!ALL\\\\) distinct such queries.  For each such \\\\(x\\\\) we build an array  \\n     \\\\[\\n       f_r \\\\;=\\\\; \\\\#\\\\{\\\\,i : a_i \\\\bmod x = r\\\\},\\\\quad r=0,1,\\\\dots,x-1\\n     \\\\]\\n     by looping once over the _unique_ values of \\\\(a\\\\).  Then a quick prefix–scan of \\\\(f\\\\) locates the median remainder.\\n   - If \\\\(x>SM\\\\!ALL\\\\), there are few blocks of the form \\\\([k\\\\,x,\\\\;k\\\\,x + \\\\text{(something)}]\\\\) in the range of \\\\(a\\\\).  We do a small binary search on the remainder \\\\(r\\\\); each check  \\n     \\\\[\\n       \\\\#\\\\{\\\\,i : a_i\\\\bmod x \\\\le r\\\\}\\n     \\\\]\\n     can be done by summing at most \\\\(\\\\lfloor\\\\max a_i/x\\\\rfloor+1\\\\) blocks via a global prefix–sum of the original frequencies.\\n\\nBy caching each distinct \\\\(x\\\\) only once and then re-using the result for repeated queries, the total work becomes roughly\\n\\n- \\\\(O(SMALL\\\\cdot n)\\\\) for the small-\\\\(x\\\\) part,\\n- \\\\(O\\\\bigl(q\\\\,(n/SMALL)\\\\,\\\\log n\\\\bigr)\\\\) for the large-\\\\(x\\\\) part,\\n\\nwhich is fast enough for \\\\(n,q\\\\le10^5\\\\) when \\\\(SMALL\\\\approx1200\\\\).\",\n        \"refusal\": null,\n        \"role\": \"assistant\",\n        \"annotations\": [],\n        \"audio\": null,\n        \"function_call\": null,\n        \"tool_calls\": null\n      },\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"protected_material_code\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"protected_material_text\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"created\": 1753310060,\n  \"model\": \"o4-mini-2025-04-16\",\n  \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n  \"service_tier\": null,\n  \"system_fingerprint\": null,\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"completion_tokens\": 13790,\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 487,\n    \"total_tokens\": 14277,\n    \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n      \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"reasoning_tokens\": 11200,\n      \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n    },\n    \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"cached_tokens\": 0\n    }\n  },\n  \"prompt_filter_results\": [\n    {\n      \"prompt_index\": 0,\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"jailbreak\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
