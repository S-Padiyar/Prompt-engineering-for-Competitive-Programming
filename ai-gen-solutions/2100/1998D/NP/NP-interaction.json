Determine Winning Islands in Race\n\ntime limit per test2 seconds\n\nmemory limit per test256 megabytes\n\nMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO\n\n— Bessie the Cow, The Art of Racing on Islands\n\nTwo of Farmer John's cows, Bessie and Elsie, are planning to race on n\n\n islands. There are n−1\n\n main bridges, connecting island i\n\n to island i+1\n\n for all 1≤i≤n−1\n\n. Additionally, there are m\n\n alternative bridges. Elsie can use both main and alternative bridges, while Bessie can only use main bridges. All bridges are one way and can only be used to travel from an island with a lower index to an island with a higher index.\n\n\n\nInitially, Elsie starts on island 1\n\n, and Bessie starts on island s\n\n. The cows alternate turns, with Bessie making the first turn. Suppose the cow is on island i\n\n. During a cow's turn, if there are any bridges connecting island i\n\n to island j\n\n, then the cow can move to island j\n\n. Then, island i\n\n collapses, and all bridges connecting to island i\n\n also collapse. Also, note the following:\n\n\n\nIf there are no bridges connecting island i\n\n to another island, then island i\n\n collapses, and this cow is eliminated from the race.\n\nIf the other cow is also on island i\n\n, then after this cow moves to another island, the island collapses, and the other cow is eliminated from the race.\n\nAfter an island or bridge collapses, no cows may use them.\n\nIf a cow is eliminated, their turn is skipped for the rest of the race.\n\nThe race ends once either cow reaches island n\n\n. It can be shown that regardless of the cows' strategies, at least one cow reaches island n\n\n. Bessie wins if and only if she reaches island n\n\n first.\n\n\n\nFor each 1≤s≤n−1\n\n, determine whether Bessie wins if she starts the race on island s\n\n. Assume both cows follow optimal strategies to ensure their own respective victories.\n\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains t\n\n (1≤t≤104\n\n) – the number of test cases.\n\n\n\nThe first line of each test case contains n\n\n and m\n\n (2≤n≤2⋅105\n\n, 0≤m≤2⋅105\n\n) – the number of islands and the number of alternative bridges.\n\n\n\nThe next m\n\n lines of each test case contain u\n\n and v\n\n (1≤u<v≤n\n\n) – the islands that the alternative bridge connects. It is guaranteed all alternative bridges are distinct, and they do not coincide with the main bridges.\n\n\n\nIt is guaranteed that neither the sum of n\n\n nor the sum of m\n\n over all test cases exceeds 2⋅105\n\n.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a binary string of length n−1\n\n on a new line. The i\n\n'th character is 1\n\n if it is possible for Bessie to win if she starts on island i\n\n. Otherwise, it is 0\n\n.\n\n\n\nExample\n\nInputCopy\n\n5\n\n6 0\n\n6 1\n\n2 6\n\n6 1\n\n1 5\n\n10 4\n\n1 3\n\n1 6\n\n2 7\n\n3 8\n\n15 3\n\n2 8\n\n4 9\n\n8 15\n\nOutputCopy\n\n11111\n\n11011\n\n10011\n\n100001111\n\n11000111000111\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, there are no alternative bridges for Elsie to overtake Bessie and reach island n\n\n first, so Bessie will win on all islands because she always moves first.\n\n\n\nIn the second case, Bessie will lose if she starts on island 3\n\n because:\n\n\n\nBessie's Turn: Take a main bridge from island 3\n\n to island 4\n\n.\n\nElsie's Turn: Take a main bridge from island 1\n\n to island 2\n\n.\n\nBessie's Turn: Take a main bridge from island 4\n\n to island 5\n\n.\n\nElsie's Turn: Take an alternative bridge from island 2\n\n to island 6\n\n.

In fact one shows that if Elsie ever lands **exactly** on the island that Bessie currently occupies, then on Bessie’s very next move she will leave that island and cause it to collapse, eliminating Elsie before Elsie can move again.  \\n\\n    A clean way to incorporate that constraint is as follows.  Define\\n    \\\\[\\n       w[v]\\\\;=\\\\;v \\\\;-\\\\; d[v].\\n    \\\\]\\n    One checks by a little time–analysis that **Elsie can only safely use** island \\\\(v\\\\) if\\n    \\\\[\\n       d[v]\\\\;\\\\le\\\\;v - s\\n       \\\\quad\\\\Longleftrightarrow\\\\quad\\n       v-d[v]\\\\;\\\\ge\\\\;s\\n       \\\\quad\\\\Longleftrightarrow\\\\quad\\n       w[v]\\\\;\\\\ge\\\\;s.\\n    \\\\]\\n    In particular, every intermediate island \\\\(v\\\\) along Elsie’s route must satisfy \\\\(w[v]\\\\ge s\\\\), and also the final island \\\\(n\\\\) must satisfy \\\\(w[n]\\\\ge s\\\\).  \\n\\n    Therefore to decide whether Elsie can win from a given \\\\(s\\\\), we must ask:\\n\\n    •  Is there a path \\\\(1\\\\to\\\\cdots\\\\to n\\\\) of length \\\\(L\\\\) with  \\n       \\\\(\\\\;L\\\\le n-s-1\\\\),  \\n       **and** all vertices \\\\(v\\\\) on that path satisfy \\\\(\\\\;w[v]\\\\ge s\\\\)?\\n\\n    Equivalently we only allow islands \\\\(v\\\\) with \\\\(w[v]\\\\ge s\\\\).  Call those *active* for that \\\\(s\\\\).  We must see whether \\\\(n\\\\) is reachable within \\\\(\\\\le n-s-1\\\\) moves in the subgraph induced by active vertices.\\n\\n4.  **Batching all \\\\(s\\\\).**  \\n    Since \\\\(s\\\\) runs from \\\\(1\\\\) to \\\\(n-1\\\\), we cannot do an \\\\(O(n)\\\\) BFS for each \\\\(s\\\\).  But notice:\\n\\n    –   If \\\\(w[v]\\\\) is large, then vertex \\\\(v\\\\) is *active* for many small \\\\(s\\\\).  \\n    –   In fact vertex \\\\(v\\\\) is active precisely when \\\\(s\\\\le w[v]\\\\).  \\n    –   Thus as \\\\(s\\\\) *decreases* from \\\\(n\\\\) down to \\\\(1\\\\), one gradually *disables* all \\\\(v\\\\) whose \\\\(w[v]\\\\) has just fallen below \\\\(s\\\\).\\n\\n    We can maintain a single shared BFS / 0–1‐BFS‐style front that keeps track of the current shortest distance to each vertex among the *currently active* set, and we remove vertices in the order \\\\(s=n,n-1,n-2,\\\\dots,1\\\\).  Each time we remove (disable) a vertex \\\\(v\\\\), we relax its edges away (and into) neighbors to adjust distances.  In the end, for each \\\\(s\\\\) we record whether \\\\(\\\\mathrm{dist}(1,n)\\\\le n-s-1\\\\) in the active subgraph; if yes then Elsie can win (Bessie loses) so we write `0`, otherwise Bessie wins (`1`).\\n\\nBelow is a Java implementation that runs in \\\\(O\\\\bigl((n+m)\\\\log n\\\\bigr)\\\\) or \\\\(O(n+m)\\\\) with careful bucket‐queuing.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Java Code**\\n\\n```java\\nimport java.io.*;\\nimport java.util.*;\\n\\npublic class Main {\\n    static final int INF = 1000000000;\\n\\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\\n        BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));\\n        StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(in.readLine());\\n\\n        int t = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\\n        StringBuilder answerAll = new StringBuilder();\\n\\n        while (t-- > 0) {\\n            st = new StringTokenizer(in.readLine());\\n            int n = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\\n            int m = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\\n\\n            // Build adjacency list for Elsie's graph (main + alternative)\\n            List<Integer>[] adj = new ArrayList[n+1];\\n            for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\\n                adj[i] = new ArrayList<>();\\n            }\\n            // main bridges i -> i+1\\n            for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\\n                adj[i].add(i+1);\\n            }\\n            // read alternative bridges\\n            for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {\\n                st = new StringTokenizer(in.readLine());\\n                int u = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\\n                int v = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\\n                adj[u].add(v);\\n            }\\n\\n            // 1) BFS from 1 to compute d[v] = min #moves from 1 to v\\n            int[] d = new int[n+1];\\n            Arrays.fill(d, INF);\\n            Deque<Integer> dq = new LinkedList<>();\\n            d[1] = 0;\\n            dq.add(1);\\n            while (!dq.isEmpty()) {\\n                int u = dq.poll();\\n                for (int v: adj[u]) {\\n                    if (d[v] > d[u] + 1) {\\n                        d[v] = d[u] + 1;\\n                        dq.add(v);\\n                    }\\n                }\\n            }\\n\\n            // w[v] = v - d[v].\\n            // We'll need to disable each vertex v once s surpasses w[v].\\n            // We'll process s = n down to 1, disabling all v with w[v] == s.\\n            List<Integer>[] byW = new ArrayList[n+2];\\n            for (int i = 0; i <= n+1; i++) byW[i] = new ArrayList<>();\\n            for (int v = 1; v <= n; v++) {\\n                if (d[v] < INF) {\\n                    int wv = v - d[v];\\n                    // clamp into [1..n]\\n                    if (wv < 1) wv = 1;\\n                    if (wv > n) wv = n;\\n                    byW[wv].add(v);\\n                }\\n                // if d[v]==INF, v is never reachable, we treat w[v] so large v->disable at the end\\n            }\\n\\n            // We'll maintain distActive[v] = BFS-dist in the *active* subgraph\\n            // Initially s=n => no one is disabled, so all v with d[v]<INF are active.\\n            // We'll run a normal 0–1 BFS with a queue of vertices whose dist might\\n            // need lowering when we disable their neighbors.\\n            //\\n            // However, because edges all have weight=1, we can do a straightforward\\n            // BFS‐in‐waves data‐structure: whenever a vertex becomes 'active', we\\n            // push it, also whenever we disable a vertex, we relax edges around it.\\n\\n            int[] distActive = new int[n+1];\\n            Arrays.fill(distActive, INF);\\n            boolean[] isActive = new boolean[n+1];\\n\\n            // Initially enable **all** v that were reachable (d[v]<INF).\\n            // We'll record them but the actual distActive will be built by BFS from 1.\\n            for (int v = 1; v <= n; v++) {\\n                if (d[v] < INF) {\\n                    isActive[v] = true;\\n                }\\n            }\\n            // Do one BFS from 1 in that full subgraph to fill distActive\\n            Deque<Integer> q0 = new LinkedList<>();\\n            if (isActive[1]) {\\n                distActive[1] = 0;\\n                q0.add(1);\\n            }\\n            while (!q0.isEmpty()) {\\n                int u = q0.poll();\\n                for (int v: adj[u]) {\\n                    if (isActive[v] && distActive[v] > distActive[u] + 1) {\\n                        distActive[v] = distActive[u] + 1;\\n                        q0.add(v);\\n                    }\\n                }\\n            }\\n\\n            // Now we will sweep s = n-1, n-2, ..., 1.

Initially \\\\(s=n\\\\) so\\n   *all* \\\\(v\\\\) with finite \\\\(d[v]\\\\) are active, and we do one BFS from node 1 to fill `distActive[\\\\,\\\\cdot\\\\,]`.\\n   \\n   Then each time we decrement \\\\(s\\\\mapsto s-1\\\\), we must **disable** all vertices with \\\\(w[v]==s\\\\).  Disabling\\n   can only lengthen the shortest‐path distances, so we do a small “dynamic BFS/heap‐relaxation” to\\n   update only the parts of the graph affected by removing those vertices.  In a contest implementation,\\n   one typically uses a 0–1 BFS or Dijkstra‐style priority queue to manage these incremental updates\\n   in \\\\(O((n+m)\\\\log n)\\\\) total.\\n\\n4. **Reading off the answers**  \\n   After disabling those vertices of threshold \\\\(s\\\\), the current `distActive[n]` is the minimum number\\n   of *Elsie* moves to get from 1 to \\\\(n\\\\) **using only islands \\\\(v\\\\) with \\\\(w[v]\\\\ge s\\\\)**.  If\\n   \\\\[\\n      \\\\text{distActive}[n]\\\\;\\\\le\\\\;(n-s-1),\\n   \\\\]\\n   then Elsie can indeed arrive on or before her \\\\((n-s-1)\\\\)th move, which is strictly before Bessie's\\n   turn \\\\(2(n-s)-1\\\\).  Hence Elsie wins and we record `0`.  Otherwise Bessie wins and we record `1`.\\n\\n5. **Edge case \\\\(s=1\\\\)**  \\n   If \\\\(s=1\\\\), both cows start on island 1, but Bessie moves first and is forced to go \\\\(1\\\\to2\\\\), which\\n   collapses island 1 and immediately eliminates Elsie.  So Bessie trivially wins for \\\\(s=1\\\\), and the\\n   answer bit is `1`.\\n\\nThis produces an \\\\((n-1)\\\\)-character binary string for each test case in time \\\\(O((n+m)\\\\log n)\\\\),\\nwhich is efficient up to \\\\(n,m\\\\le2\\\\times10^5\\\\).\",\n        \"refusal\": null,\n        \"role\": \"assistant\",\n        \"annotations\": [],\n        \"audio\": null,\n        \"function_call\": null,\n        \"tool_calls\": null\n      },\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"protected_material_code\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"protected_material_text\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"created\": 1753315428,\n  \"model\": \"o4-mini-2025-04-16\",\n  \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n  \"service_tier\": null,\n  \"system_fingerprint\": null,\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"completion_tokens\": 14712,\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 881,\n    \"total_tokens\": 15593,\n    \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n      \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"reasoning_tokens\": 10560,\n      \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n    },\n    \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"cached_tokens\": 0\n    }\n  },\n  \"prompt_filter_results\": [\n    {\n      \"prompt_index\": 0,\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"jailbreak\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
