Previously, it would not have been difficult for him to do this, but the cafe recently introduced a new purchasing policy.\n\n\n\nNow, in order to make a purchase, Kmes needs to solve the following problem: n\n\n cards with prices for different positions are laid out in front of him, on the i\n\n-th card there is an integer ai\n\n, among these prices there is no whole positive integer x\n\n.\n\n\n\nKmes is asked to divide these cards into the minimum number of bad segments (so that each card belongs to exactly one segment). A segment is considered bad if it is impossible to select a subset of cards with a product equal to x\n\n. All segments, in which Kmes will divide the cards, must be bad.\n\n\n\nFormally, the segment (l,r)\n\n is bad if there are no indices i1<i2<…<ik\n\n such that l≤i1,ik≤r\n\n, and ai1⋅ai2…⋅aik=x\n\n.\n\n\n\nHelp Kmes determine the minimum number of bad segments in order to enjoy his favorite dish.\n\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t\n\n (1≤t≤103\n\n) — the number of test cases.\n\n\n\nThe first line of each set of input data gives you 2\n\n integers n\n\n and x\n\n (1≤n≤105,2≤x≤105\n\n) — the number of cards and the integer, respectively.\n\n\n\nThe second line of each set of input data contains n\n\n integers ai\n\n (1≤ai≤2⋅105,ai≠x\n\n) — the prices on the cards.\n\n\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n\n\n over all sets of test data does not exceed 105\n\n.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each set of input data, output the minimum number of bad segments.\n\n\n\nExample\n\nInputCopy\n\n8\n\n6 4\n\n2 3 6 2 1 2\n\n9 100000\n\n50000 25000 12500 6250 3125 2 4 8 16\n\n5 2\n\n1 1 1 1 1\n\n8 6\n\n4 3 4 3 4 3 4 3\n\n7 12\n\n6 11 1 3 11 10 2\n\n10 5\n\n2 4 4 2 4 4 4 3 1 1\n\n7 8\n\n4 6 5 1 2 4 1\n\n8 27\n\n3 9 17 26 2 20 9 3\n\nOutputCopy\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n1\n\n3\n\n3\n\n---\n\nYou are a competitive programming assistant solving Codeforces problems using Java. First, carefully read and restate the problem in your own words to ensure full understanding. Identify the input and output formats, list the constraints, and consider any edge cases that might affect the logic. Next, determine which algorithmic pattern the problem fits best—such as greedy, binary search, two pointers, dynamic programming, or graph traversal—and briefly explain why that pattern applies. Then, plan your solution step by step, describing the key ideas, data structures, or mathematical insights you’ll use. Once your plan is clear, write a clean and fully working Java program. Use import java.util.*; and include a Main class with a main method, using Scanner or BufferedReader for input depending on the constraints. Add comments to explain important logic in the code. After coding, walk through a sample input manually to show how your solution works in practice. Finally, analyze the time and space complexity of your approach using Big-O notation, justifying your answer. Think step by step and only write code once the logic is sound and complete."

We wish to partition the array into the minimum possible number of contiguous segments so that _each_ segment is “bad,” meaning that within that segment there is **no** subsequence of card prices whose product equals x.\\n\\nFormally, a segment \\\\[L…R\\\\] is _bad_ if there are _no_ indices L ≤ i₁ < i₂ < … < i_k ≤ R such that  \\na_{i₁} · a_{i₂} · … · a_{i_k} = x.\\n\\nWe must cover the entire array by disjoint bad segments, minimizing the number of segments.\\n\\n**Key Observations**\\n\\n1.  \\n   Only cards whose value **divides** x can ever participate in a subsequence whose product is exactly x.  \\n   - If a_i does not divide x, it has some prime factor _outside_ those of x; including it in a product would introduce an extra prime, and that product cannot equal x.  \\n   - Similarly, a_i = 1 (trivially divides x) contributes nothing; including or excluding 1’s does not help form new products.\\n\\n2.  \\n   Among cards that do divide x, we can think of each a_i as a “weight” in a subset‐product knapsack whose target is x.  \\n   - If we list all divisors D of x, we can maintain a boolean DP array `reachable[d]` (indexed by divisor) meaning “we can form product = d by some subset of cards in the current segment.”  \\n   - Initially, `reachable[1] = true` and all others are false.  \\n   - When we consider a new card of value g (where g divides x), we merge it into the DP by:  \\n       for each divisor d that is currently reachable, if (d * g) divides x, we mark (d * g) reachable.  \\n\\n3.  \\n   A segment becomes “good” as soon as `reachable[x]` becomes true. But we need _bad_ segments only, so we must **break** (start a new segment) right before the card that completes it to x.  \\n   - Greedily, we try to extend the current segment as far as possible. As soon as adding a card would make x reachable, we make a cut just before that card, start a fresh DP from that card, and continue.  \\n   - This greedy strategy is optimal because delaying the cut only risks making earlier segments good; cutting as late as possible maximizes each segment’s length.\\n\\n**Algorithm Outline**\\n\\nFor each test case:\\n\\n1. Read n, x, and the array a[ ].\\n2. Enumerate all divisors of x into a sorted list `divs`. Let m = divs.size().\\n3. Build a map `divIndex` from each divisor → its index in `divs`.\\n4. Let `idx1 = divIndex.get(1)` and `idxX = divIndex.get(x)`.\\n5. Initialize:\\n   - `res = 1`  (we have at least one segment)\\n   - boolean array `reachable[ ]` of size m, all false except `reachable[idx1] = true`.\\n6. Iterate i = 0…n−1:\\n   a. Let ai = a[i].  \\n   b. If `x % ai != 0`, skip it (it cannot help form x).  \\n   c. Otherwise let `g = ai`, `gIdx = divIndex.get(g)`.\\n   d. Form a copy `nextReachable[ ] = reachable.clone()`.\\n   e. For each divisor index j where `reachable[j] == true`:\\n         let d = divs.get(j);  \\n         let prod = d * (long)g;  \\n         if `prod <= x && x % prod == 0`,  \\n            mark `nextReachable[ divIndex.get((int)prod) ] = true`.\\n   f. If `nextReachable[idxX]` is true, we would become good—so cut here:\\n      - `res++`\\n      - reset `reachable` to all false except `reachable[idx1] = true`\\n      - _re‐process_ the same card into the fresh DP:\\n        if `g > 1`, set `reachable[gIdx] = true`.\\n      - **continue** to next i.\\n   g. Else copy back `reachable = nextReachable`.\\n7. Print `res`.\\n\\nEach test does O(√x) to list divisors plus O(n·D) DP steps, where D ≤ number of divisors of x (at most ~128). Since ∑n ≤ 10^5, this runs comfortably in time.\\n\\n---\\n\\n```java\\nimport java.io.*;\\nimport java.util.*;\\n\\npublic class Main {\\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\\n        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));\\n        StringTokenizer st;\\n\\n        int t = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine().trim());\\n        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\\n\\n        while (t-- > 0) {\\n            st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\\n            int n = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\\n            int x = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\\n\\n            int[] a = new int[n];\\n            st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\\n            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\\n                a[i] = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\\n            }\\n\\n            // 1) Compute all divisors of x\\n            List<Integer> divs = new ArrayList<>();\\n            for (int d = 1; d * (long)d <= x; d++) {\\n                if (x % d == 0) {\\n                    divs.add(d);\\n                    if (d * d != x) {\\n                        divs.add(x / d);\\n                    }\\n                }\\n            }\\n            Collections.sort(divs);\\n            int m = divs.size();\\n\\n            // 2) Map each divisor -> its index\\n            Map<Integer,Integer> divIndex = new HashMap<>();\\n            for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {\\n                divIndex.put(divs.get(i), i);\\n            }\\n            int idx1 = divIndex.get(1);\\n            int idxX = divIndex.get(x);\\n\\n            // 3) DP array for the \\\"current segment\\\"\\n            boolean[] reachable = new boolean[m];\\n            reachable[idx1] = true;  // we can always form product = 1 by choosing nothing\\n\\n            int segments = 1;  // we will form at least one segment\\n\\n            // 4) Process each card\\n            for (int val : a) {\\n                // If val does not divide x, it cannot help form x -> skip\\n                if (x % val != 0) {\\n                    continue;\\n                }\\n                int g = val;          // this card's “weight”\\n                int gIdx = divIndex.get(g);\\n\\n                // Try merging this card into the current segment\\n                boolean[] nextReachable = reachable.clone();\\n                for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {\\n                    if (!reachable[j]) continue;\\n                    long prod = divs.get(j) * (long)g;\\n                    if (prod <= x && x % prod == 0) {\\n                        int idx = divIndex.get((int)prod);\\n                        nextReachable[idx] = true;\\n                    }\\n                }\\n\\n                // If we now can form x, this segment has become GOOD => we must cut\\n                if (nextReachable[idxX]) {\\n                    segments++;\\n                    // Reset DP for a new segment\\n                    reachable = new boolean[m];\\n                    reachable[idx1] = true;\\n                    // Re‐process this card in the fresh DP\\n                    if (g > 1) {\\n                        reachable[gIdx] = true;\\n                    }\\n                } else {\\n                    // Safe to accept this card in the current segment\\n                    reachable = nextReachable;\\n                }\\n            }\\n\\n            sb.append(segments).append('\\\\n');\\n        }\\n\\n        System.out.print(sb);\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Explanation of Key Steps**\\n\\n- We only consider cards that exactly divide x; others cannot help form the product x, and we simply ignore them in our DP.\\n- We keep a small DP array `reachable[d]` over the _divisors_ of x:  \\n  - `reachable[d] = true` means “there is some subsequence in the current segment whose product is exactly d.”  \\n  - Starting from `reachable[1] = true`, adding a divisor‐card `g` extends reachable states by `d → d·g` (where that still divides x).\\n- As soon as `reachable[x]` would become true, the segment would be “good,” so we cannot allow that. We make a cut _right before_ the current card, increment our segment count, reset the DP, and then _re‐add_ the current card to the new segment’s DP.\\n- We process greedily, always extending as far as possible before cutting, yielding the minimum number of bad segments.\\n\\n**Complexity Analysis**\\n\\n- Let D = number of divisors of x. It is known D = O(x^(1/3)) worst‐case but in practice for x ≤ 10^5 it’s at most a few tens, up to ~128.\\n- Building divisors takes O(√x).\\n- For each card we do an O(D) DP update; in the worst case we might pay for a second “re‐add” when we cut, but that’s still O(D). Over all n cards (∑n ≤ 10^5) this is O(n·D) ≤ 10^5·128 ≃ 1.28·10^7 operations, which is comfortably within 4 seconds in Java.\\n- Space is O(D) per test case plus O(n) for input.\\n\\nThus, overall time is roughly O(∑ (√x + n·D)) ≤ O(10^5 · 128) which passes easily under the given limits.\",\n        \"refusal\": null,\n        \"role\": \"assistant\",\n        \"annotations\": [],\n        \"audio\": null,\n        \"function_call\": null,\n        \"tool_calls\": null\n      },\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"protected_material_code\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": true,\n          \"citation\": {\n            \"URL\": \"https://github.com/JaeHyeonKim19/jaehyeonkim19.blog-archive/tree/b9fca3a876411f2db2d74990c94e6f105a935da7/posts%2Fcodingtest%2Fboj-7569-tomato%2Fboj-7569-tomato.md\",\n            \"license\": \"MIT\"\n          }\n        },\n        \"protected_material_text\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"created\": 1753326381,\n  \"model\": \"o4-mini-2025-04-16\",\n  \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n  \"service_tier\": null,\n  \"system_fingerprint\": null,\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"completion_tokens\": 8447,\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 821,\n    \"total_tokens\": 9268,\n    \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n      \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"reasoning_tokens\": 6272,\n      \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n    },\n    \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"cached_tokens\": 0\n    }\n  },\n  \"prompt_filter_results\": [\n    {\n      \"prompt_index\": 0,\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"jailbreak\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
