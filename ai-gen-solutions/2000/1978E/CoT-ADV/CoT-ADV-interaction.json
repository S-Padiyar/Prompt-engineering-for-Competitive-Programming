Computing Machine\n\ntime limit per test2 seconds\n\nmemory limit per test256 megabytes\n\nSasha has two binary strings s\n\n and t\n\n of the same length n\n\n, consisting of the characters 0 and 1.\n\n\n\nThere is also a computing machine that can perform two types of operations on binary strings a\n\n and b\n\n of the same length k\n\n:\n\n\n\nIf ai=ai+2=\n\n 0, then you can assign bi+1:=\n\n 1 (1≤i≤k−2\n\n).\n\nIf bi=bi+2=\n\n 1, then you can assign ai+1:=\n\n 1 (1≤i≤k−2\n\n).\n\nSasha became interested in the following: if we consider the string a=slsl+1…sr\n\n and the string b=tltl+1…tr\n\n, what is the maximum number of 1 characters in the string a\n\n that can be obtained using the computing machine. Since Sasha is very curious but lazy, it is up to you to answer this question for several pairs (li,ri)\n\n that interest him.\n\n\n\nInput\n\nEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t\n\n (1≤t≤104\n\n) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.\n\n\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer n\n\n (1≤n≤2⋅105\n\n) — the length of the strings s\n\n and t\n\n.\n\n\n\nThe second line of each test case contains a binary string s\n\n of length n\n\n, consisting of the characters 0 and 1.\n\n\n\nThe third line of each test case contains a binary string t\n\n of length n\n\n, consisting of the characters 0 and 1.\n\n\n\nThe fourth line of each test case contains a single integer q\n\n (1≤q≤2⋅105\n\n) — the number of queries.\n\n\n\nThe i\n\n-th of the following lines contains two integers li\n\n and ri\n\n (1≤li≤ri≤n\n\n) — the boundaries of the i\n\n-th pair of substrings that interest Sasha.\n\n\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n\n\n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105\n\n and the sum of q\n\n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105\n\n.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output q\n\n integers — the answers to all queries.\n\n\n\nExample\n\nInputCopy\n\n3\n\n4\n\n1111\n\n0000\n\n2\n\n1 2\n\n2 4\n\n4\n\n1010\n\n1101\n\n2\n\n1 3\n\n1 4\n\n6\n\n010101\n\n011010\n\n5\n\n2 3\n\n1 6\n\n2 5\n\n4 4\n\n3 6\n\nOutputCopy\n\n2\n\n3\n\n2\n\n3\n\n1\n\n4\n\n3\n\n1\n\n2\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case:\n\n\n\nIn the first query, a=\n\n 11, so the maximum number of 1 characters is 2\n\n.\n\nIn the second query, a=\n\n 111, so the maximum number of 1 characters is 3\n\n.\n\nIn the second test case:\n\n\n\nIn the first query, a=\n\n 101 and b=\n\n 110. No operations can be performed, so the maximum number of 1 characters is 2\n\n.\n\nIn the second query, a=\n\n 1010 and b=\n\n 1101. Since a2=a4=\n\n 0, we can assign b3:=\n\n 1. Now b1=b3=\n\n 1, so we can assign a2:=\n\n 1. The string a\n\n becomes 1110, so the maximum number of 1 characters is 3\n\n.\n\n---\n\nYou are a competitive programming assistant solving Codeforces problems using Java. First, carefully read and restate the problem in your own words to ensure full understanding. Identify the input and output formats, list the constraints, and consider any edge cases that might affect the logic. Next, determine which algorithmic pattern the problem fits best—such as greedy, binary search, two pointers, dynamic programming, or graph traversal—and briefly explain why that pattern applies. Then, plan your solution step by step, describing the key ideas, data structures, or mathematical insights you’ll use. Once your plan is clear, write a clean and fully working Java program. Use import java.util.*; and include a Main class with a main method, using Scanner or BufferedReader for input depending on the constraints. Add comments to explain important logic in the code. After coding, walk through a sample input manually to show how your solution works in practice. Finally, analyze the time and space complexity of your approach using Big-O notation, justifying your answer. Think step by step and only write code once the logic is sound and complete."

We will be given many queries, each query specifies a substring range \\\\[l…r\\\\].  Define\\n\\n  a = s[l…r],  \\n  b = t[l…r].\\n\\nWe may perform as many of these two (only-monotone‐marks) operations as we like on the pair (a,b), always within the substring indices (1…k) where k = r−l+1:\\n\\n1) If a[i] = a[i+2] = 0 (for 1 ≤ i ≤ k−2), we may set b[i+1] := 1.  \\n2) If b[i] = b[i+2] = 1 (for 1 ≤ i ≤ k−2), we may set a[i+1] := 1.  \\n\\nOnce a bit is turned to 1, it never returns to 0; similarly in b.  We want to make as many 1’s as possible in the final a.\\n\\nObserve that flipping bits in b depends only on zeros in a at distance 2, and flipping bits in a depends only on ones in b at distance 2.  Since flipping bits is monotone (only 0→1), the following “two‐phase” strategy is optimal:\\n\\n  Phase 1 (a→b):  Flip every b-position you can, based on the *original* a-zeros.  \\n  Phase 2 (b→a):  Then flip every a-position you can, based on the augmented b.\\n\\nIt can be shown no further “back‐and‐forth” increases the final a-ones.  Concretely, for each substring position j (in global coordinates) that is not at the very ends,\\n\\n  b[j] will end up 1 if either\\n     • t[j] == '1',  or\\n     • s[j−1] == '0' and s[j+1] == '0'\\n     (here we only consider j−1, j+1 within the substring; outside we treat as ineligible.)\\n\\nThen a[j] will end up 1 if either\\n     • s[j] == '1',  or\\n     • b'[j−1] == 1 and b'[j+1] == 1.\\n\\nSince each query range \\\\[l…r\\\\] only allows “distance-2” within \\\\[l…r\\\\], the boundary positions use the original t[l] or t[r] when neighbor is out of range.\\n\\nHence per query we can do:\\n\\n1) Count the original number of ‘1’s in s[l…r].

That captures exactly all the new 1’s we can inject into the copy of `t[l…r]`.\\n\\n2. **Phase 2 precompute**:  \\n   For each `i=2…n−1`, if originally `s[i]=='0'` but both `canB[i-1]` and `canB[i+1]` are true, then we can turn `s[i]→1`.  We mark `goodA[i]=1` for that, and build a prefix sum `prefG` to allow range‐sum queries in O(1).\\n\\n3. **Query**:  \\n   - We always take the original “base” count of ones in `s[l…r]` by `prefS[r]−prefS[l−1]`.  \\n   - If the segment length ≤2, no operation applies, so that is the final answer.  \\n   - Otherwise, we add three pieces:\\n     a) the sum of `goodA[i]` for all *interior* `i` where both neighbors are also interior (i.e.\\\\ `i∈[l+2…r−2]`), via `prefG`.\\n     b) one boundary check at `i=l+1` (if valid), where “left‐neighbor” is `t[l]` and “right‐neighbor” is either `canB[l+2]` or `t[r]` if `l+2==r`.  \\n     c) a symmetric boundary check at `i=r−1`.  \\n\\nSince all these are O(1) arithmetic/lookups per query, the total is O(n + q) per test.
