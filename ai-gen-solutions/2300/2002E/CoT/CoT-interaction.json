Below is a sketch of a full solution in Java.  The key ideas are\\n\\n 1.  We maintain for each color `c` a small state object `State[c]` which describes\\n    - the current “component‐death‐time” `t` so far (that is, how long the best merged‐so‐far block of color `c` will take to completely go away),\\n    - the “residual length” `r` of that component **at time** `t` (how many elements are still left in that merged run exactly at time `t`).\\n\\n 2.  When we see a new block `(a,b)`, there are two ways to attach it onto the old component of color `b`:\\n    A)  **don’t merge** – just let this new block stand alone; its own death‐time is `a`, residual at that moment `0`.\\n    B)  **merge** with the old component – but only if both survive long enough so that the entire “middle” in‐between (i.e.\\\\ all blocks from the last occurrence of `b` up to the new one) has died.  By tracking the global prefix‐strengths we can know exactly *when* the middle died; at that instant each of the two same‐color components has been whittled down by exactly that many seconds, so their **leftover** sizes are `(old.r + old.t ‑ t_mid)` and `(a ‑ t_mid)`, giving a merged component of total size\\n         (old.r + old.t ‑ t_mid) + (a ‑ t_mid)\\n      which then disappears exactly `that_sum` seconds *after* `t_mid`, i.e.\\\\ at time\\n         `t_mid + (old.r + old.t ‑ t_mid) + (a ‑ t_mid)  =  old.t + a ‑ t_mid`\\n      with residual `0` at that final moment.\\n\\n 3.  We keep the **prefix‐strength** `P[i]` for each `i`, that is “how long it takes the entire run up to `i` to die.”  Whenever you finish updating the state for color `b`, you know that the overall prefix‐strength either stays the same or improves to the new component‐death‐time of color `b`.\\n\\n 4.  To do (2B) you must know `t_mid = strength(prev_b+1 … i-1)`.  But that is just `P[i-1] –  P[prev_b]` where `P[k]` is the strength of the first `k` blocks if you “pretend you stopped right at block `k`.”  (In other words, if you look at blocks `(prev+1) … (i-1)` in isolation, they die exactly at `P[i-1]`, and the structure up to and including block `prev` died at time `P[prev]`, so the subarray in the middle finished dying at time `P[i-1]` **relative** to when block `prev` dropped out, i.e.\\\\ at local time `P[i-1] – P[prev]`.)\\n\\nPutting all that together you get an `O(n)`‐time solution with just a couple of arrays.  Here is the complete code:\\n\\n```java\\nimport java.io.*;\\nimport java.util.*;\\n\\npublic class Main {\\n  static class State {\\n    // t = death-time of the best merged run of this color so far\\n    // r = how many elements remain in that run exactly at time t (so next second they'd start disappearing).\\n    long t, r;\\n    State() { t = 0; r = 0; }\\n  }\\n\\n  public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\\n    BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));\\n    StringTokenizer tok = new StringTokenizer(in.readLine());\\n    int T = Integer.parseInt(tok.nextToken());\\n\\n    StringBuilder out = new StringBuilder();\\n    while (T-- > 0) {\\n      tok = new StringTokenizer(in.readLine());\\n      int n = Integer.parseInt(tok.nextToken());\\n\\n      long[] A = new long[n+1];\\n      int[]  B = new int[n+1];\\n      for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++){\\n        tok = new StringTokenizer(in.readLine());\\n        A[i] = Long.parseLong(tok.nextToken());\\n        B[i] = Integer.parseInt(tok.nextToken());\\n      }\\n\\n      // We'll keep track of P[i] = strength of prefix up to i\\n      long[] P = new long[n+1];\\n      // And for each color, the last block index we saw of that color\\n      int[] last   = new int[n+1];\\n      // And each color's current merged-state\\n      State[] st   = new State[n+1];\\n      for (int c = 0; c <= n; c++) {\\n        last[c] = 0;\\n        st[c] = new State();\\n      }\\n\\n      P[0] = 0;\\n\\n      for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++){\\n        int  c = B[i];\\n        long a = A[i];\\n\\n        // 1) The middle will die at time (P[i-1] - P[last[c]])\\n        long t_mid = P[i-1] - P[ last[c] ];\\n\\n        // Option A: do not merge, this block alone dies at time a, residual = 0\\n        long bestT = a;\\n        long bestR = 0;\\n\\n        // Option B: try to merge with the old state st[c]\\n        if (last[c] != 0) {\\n          State old = st[c];\\n          // both must still be alive at t_mid => t_mid < old.t  AND  t_mid < a\\n          if (t_mid < old.t && t_mid < a) {\\n            // merged death-time:\\n            long mergedDeath = old.t + a - t_mid;\\n            // at that moment there's nothing left (residual=0)\\n            bestT = Math.max(bestT, mergedDeath);\\n            bestR = 0;\\n          }\\n        }\\n\\n        // save the new state for color c\\n        st[c].t = bestT;\\n        st[c].r = bestR;\\n\\n        last[c] = i;\\n\\n        // 2) The whole prefix's strength P[i] is either what it was, or improved by finishing\\n        //    the newly updated color-component later.\\n        P[i] = Math.max(P[i-1], bestT);\\n      }\\n\\n      // print P[1..n]\\n      for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\\n        out.append(P[i]).append(i==n?'\\\\n':' ');\\n      }\\n    }\\n\\n    System.out.print(out);\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nExplanation of the three main lines inside the loop:\\n\\n1.  We compute `t_mid = P[i-1] – P[last[c]]`.  \\n    This is exactly “how long it takes the segment strictly between my previous same‐color block and me to vanish.”  \\n2.  We keep two options for how I (the new block `(a,c)`) end up in the final picture:\\n    A.  “Stand alone”: I just die in `a` seconds.\\n    B.  “Merge with the old color‐`c` run”: but only if by time `t_mid` that old run still has not died **and** this new block is still positive (`t_mid < a`).  In that case the merged run’s total death‐time is  \\n         old.t + a – t_mid  \\n    which is derived from “at time `t_mid` each has been whittled down by `t_mid`, so the leftover total length is `(old.r+old.t–t_mid) + (a–t_mid)`, and from `t_mid` it takes exactly that many more seconds.”  \\n\\n3.  We update the color‐`c` state to the best of those two, and then\\n    `P[i] = max(P[i-1], st[c].t)`  \\n    because the newly updated color‐`c` component might be the overall latest‐dying run of the entire prefix.\\n\\nThis runs in O(n) per test (just a few array accesses per run), and n ≤ 3·10^5 total over all tests is perfectly fine in Java.\",\n        \"refusal\": null,\n        \"role\": \"assistant\",\n        \"annotations\": [],\n        \"audio\": null,\n        \"function_call\": null,\n        \"tool_calls\": null\n      },\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"protected_material_code\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"protected_material_text\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"created\": 1753315836,\n  \"model\": \"o4-mini-2025-04-16\",\n  \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n  \"service_tier\": null,\n  \"system_fingerprint\": null,\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"completion_tokens\": 8718,\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 833,\n    \"total_tokens\": 9551,\n    \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n      \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"reasoning_tokens\": 6848,\n      \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n    },\n    \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"cached_tokens\": 0\n    }\n  },\n  \"prompt_filter_results\": [\n    {\n      \"prompt_index\": 0,\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"jailbreak\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
