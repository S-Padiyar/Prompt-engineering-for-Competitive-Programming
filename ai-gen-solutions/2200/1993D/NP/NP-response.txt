**Analysis**

We have an array $a$ of length $n$, and in each operation we must remove a contiguous block of size exactly $k$ until the array’s length is at most $k$.  Let the final length of the array be

-   if $n\le k$, we do zero operations and keep all $n$ elements;
-   if $n>k$, we repeatedly subtract $k$ until the length is $\le k$.  One easily checks that the final length is
  
  \[
    r = 
    \begin{cases}
      n \bmod k,& n \bmod k\neq 0,\\
      k,& n\bmod k=0.
    \end{cases}
  \]

Denote by $r$ this final length.  We then take the median of those $r$ elements; by definition (for an array of length $r$) the median is the $\lfloor (r+1)/2\rfloor$-th element in sorted order.  We wish to **maximize** that median by clever choices of which $k$-blocks to remove.

A key combinatorial fact is that specifying which $k$-blocks to remove is exactly equivalent to choosing **one** survivor from each of the $r$ residue‐classes modulo $k$ among the original positions.  Concretely, if we index $a$ from $0$ to $n-1$, then the survivors must occupy exactly one index in each class

\[
  \{\,j,\, j+k,\, j+2k,\dots\}\quad (j=0,1,\dots,r-1).
\]

Those are disjoint runs of “would‐be deletions,” each run of non‐survivors has size a multiple of $k$, so we can peel off $k$‐blocks from it until it vanishes.

Thus the final survivors are
\[
  S=\{\,s_0,s_1,\dots,s_{r-1}\},\quad
  s_j\equiv j\pmod{k},\quad j=0,1,\dots,r-1,
\]
exactly one choice per residue‐class.

Now let $X$ be a candidate for “can we achieve median $\ge X$”?  To have the median (the $\lfloor (r+1)/2\rfloor$-th smallest) at least $X$, we must have

-   at least 
    \[
      T \;=\; r\;-\;\bigl\lfloor\tfrac{r+1}2\bigr\rfloor\;+\;1
    \]
    of our chosen survivors $\ge X$,
-   and we pick one survivor in each of the $r$ residue‐classes.

So for each residue‐class $j\in\{0,1,\dots,r-1\}$, we look down the arithmetic progression
\[
  j,\; j+k,\; j+2k,\;\dots
\]
and ask “is there \emph{any} $a[i]\ge X$ in that class?”  If so we call that class _good_.  We count the number of good classes.  If the number of good classes is at least $T$, we can choose $T$ of them to contribute $\ge X$ and the remaining $r-T$ arbitrarily, yielding median$\ge X$.

We thus have a monotonic condition in $X$.  We can binary‐search on $X$ in the range $[1,\max(a)]$, checking in $O(n)$ time for each $X$ whether there are at least $T$ good residue‐classes.  Overall this takes $O(n\log M)$ time per test (with $M$ up to $10^9$), which is fast enough for $\sum n\le5\times10^5$.

**Explanation of Key Steps**

1. **Final survivor‐count**  
   Repeatedly removing blocks of size $k$ from length $n$ until $\le k$ leaves
   \[
     r = 
     \begin{cases}
       n \bmod k, & n \bmod k \neq 0,\\
       k, & n \bmod k = 0.
     \end{cases}
   \]

2. **Residue‐class decomposition**  
   It’s a known combinatorial fact that “deleting contiguous blocks of size $k$ until only $r$ remain” 
   is exactly the same as “choosing exactly one survivor in each of the $r$ residue‐classes 
   $\{\,j,j+k,j+2k,\dots\}$ for $j=0,1,\dots,r-1$.”  

3. **Median condition**  
   If the final sorted survivors are $c_1\le c_2\le \cdots\le c_r$, the median is $c_{\lfloor (r+1)/2\rfloor}$.  
   To force $c_{\lfloor (r+1)/2\rfloor}\ge X$, we need **all** of $c_{\lfloor (r+1)/2\rfloor},\dots,c_r\ge X$.  
   That is $(r - \lfloor (r+1)/2\rfloor +1)$ survivors $\ge X$.  

4. **Binary search**  
   We binary‐search on $X$.  To test a given $X$, we mark a residue‐class _good_ if it contains \emph{any} 
   array value $\ge X$.  We count how many of the first $r$ residue‐classes are good; if at least 
   $r - \lfloor (r+1)/2\rfloor +1$ are good, we can choose those to be our large survivors and achieve 
   median $\ge X$.  

Each check runs in $O(n)$ by scanning at most $n$ positions once, and thus the total per test is $O(n\log(\max a_i))$, which is efficient for $\sum n\le5\cdot10^5\,$.
