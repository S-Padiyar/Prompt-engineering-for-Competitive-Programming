You know that\n\n\n\nIts words consist only of the first c\n\n letters of the Latin alphabet.\n\nEach word has a case which can be unambiguously determined by its last letter (different letters correspond to different cases). For example, words \"ABACABA\" and \"ABA\" (if they exist) have the same case in this language because they both have the same ending 'A', whereas \"ALICE\" and \"BOB\" have different cases. If the language does not have a case corresponding to some letter, it means that the word cannot end with this letter.\n\nThe length of each word is k\n\n or less.\n\nYou have a single text written in this language. Unfortunately, as the language is really ancient, spaces between words are missing and all letters are uppercase. You wonder what is the minimum number of cases the language can have. Can you find this out?\n\n\n\nInput\n\nEach test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single integer t\n\n (1≤t≤10000\n\n) — the number of test cases. It is followed by descriptions of the test cases.\n\n\n\nThe first line of each test case contains three integers n\n\n, c\n\n, k\n\n (1≤k≤n≤218\n\n, 1≤c≤18\n\n) — the length of the text, the number of letters in the language, and the maximum length of the word.\n\n\n\nThe second line contains a string of n\n\n characters — the text itself. Each character is one of the first c\n\n uppercase letters of the Latin alphabet.\n\n\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n\n\n over all test cases does not exceed 218\n\n and the sum of 2c\n\n over all test cases does not exceed 218\n\n.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single line consisting of a single integer — the minimum number of cases in the language.\n\n\n\nExample\n\nInputCopy\n\n7\n\n5 5 1\n\nABCDE\n\n3 1 2\n\nAAA\n\n3 2 2\n\nAAB\n\n10 2 2\n\nABABABABAB\n\n4 4 4\n\nDCBA\n\n1 17 1\n\nQ\n\n9 3 2\n\nABCABCABC\n\nOutputCopy\n\n5\n\n1\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, there must be five cases in the language (for each of the letters 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', and 'E' there must be a case that has a corresponding ending).\n\n\n\nIn the fourth test case, one case with ending 'B' is sufficient.\n\n---\n\nUse Java."

Words in the language have length at most \\\\(k\\\\), and each word’s “case” is determined uniquely by its last character.  Equivalently, if we pick a set \\\\(E\\\\) of letters to be the allowed word‐end letters, then we must be able to cut the string \\\\(s\\\\) into consecutive blocks (words) of length \\\\(\\\\le k\\\\), each ending in one of those letters in \\\\(E\\\\).\\n\\nWe want to choose \\\\(E\\\\subseteq\\\\{0,1,\\\\dots,c-1\\\\}\\\\) of minimum size so that such a segmentation is possible.  A well–known necessary and sufficient condition for segmentability (with max word length \\\\(k\\\\)) is:\\n\\n1.  **No gap constraint**:  in *every* window of \\\\(k\\\\) consecutive letters of the text, at least one letter must come from \\\\(E\\\\).  Otherwise you would have a run of \\\\(k\\\\) letters none of which can end a word, so you cannot place a cut in that window.\\n\\n2.  **End‐of‐string constraint**: the very last letter \\\\(s_n\\\\) must itself lie in \\\\(E\\\\), so that the final short word (of length \\\\(\\\\le k\\\\)) can legally end in an allowed case.\\n\\nThus the problem reduces to a small‐universe hitting‐set: we have a universe of \\\\(c\\\\) letters, and we have a collection of sets\\n\\n-  for each window of length \\\\(k\\\\), \\\\(W_i = \\\\{\\\\text{letters in positions }i,i+1,\\\\dots,i+k-1\\\\}\\\\);\\n-  one more set \\\\(W_{\\\\mathrm{end}} = \\\\{\\\\,s_n\\\\}\\\\).\\n\\nWe want the smallest \\\\(E\\\\) that “hits” every \\\\(W_i\\\\): that is, \\\\(E\\\\cap W_i\\\\neq\\\\emptyset\\\\) for all \\\\(i\\\\).\\n\\nSince \\\\(c\\\\le18\\\\), we can represent subsets of letters by bitmasks \\\\(0\\\\le M<(1\\\\ll c)\\\\).  We define:\\n\\n-  For each window \\\\(W_i\\\\), let \\n   \\\\[\\n     M_i = \\\\sum_{x\\\\in W_i} 2^x\\n     \\\\quad\\\\text{(the bitmask of letters in that window).}\\n   \\\\]\\n  Its complement w.r.t.\\\\ the full \\\\(c\\\\)-bit mask \\\\((1\\\\ll c)-1\\\\) is\\n  \\\\[\\n     A_i \\\\;=\\\\;\\\\bigl((1\\\\ll c)-1\\\\bigr)\\\\;\\\\oplus\\\\;M_i,\\n  \\\\]\\n  the set of letters *not* appearing in that window.\\n-  A candidate end‐set \\\\(E\\\\) (bitmask) *fails* to hit \\\\(W_i\\\\) exactly when \\\\(E\\\\cap W_i=\\\\emptyset\\\\), i.e.\\\\ when \\\\(E\\\\subseteq A_i\\\\).  \\n\\nHence if we mark `bad[A_i] = true`, then *any* \\\\(E\\\\) which is a subset of \\\\(A_i\\\\) is invalid.  Finally we do the same for the one‐letter end‐window \\\\(\\\\{s_n\\\\}\\\\), i.e.\\\\ compute \\n\\\\[\\n   A_{\\\\mathrm{end}} \\\\;=\\\\; ((1\\\\ll c)-1)\\\\;\\\\oplus\\\\;(1\\\\ll (s_n)),\\n\\\\]\\nand `bad[A_end] = true`.\\n\\nAfter gathering all these “bad” masks \\\\(A\\\\), we then mark every submask of each bad \\\\(A\\\\) itself as invalid (because any \\\\(E\\\\subseteq A\\\\) fails that constraint).  In the end we scan all masks \\\\(E\\\\in[0,2^c)\\\\), ignore those marked invalid, and take the one with smallest popcount.\\n\\nBecause \\\\(\\\\sum 2^c\\\\le2^{18}\\\\approx2.6\\\\times10^5\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\sum n\\\\le2^{18}\\\\), the total clearing and mask–scanning runs in a few \\\\(10^5\\\\)-\\\\(10^6\\\\) steps overall, which is perfectly fine for \\\\(t\\\\le10^4\\\\).\\n\\n**Implementation in Java**\\n\\n```java\\nimport java.io.*;\\nimport java.util.*;\\n\\npublic class Main {\\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\\n        // Fast input\\n        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));\\n        PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(System.out);\\n\\n        int t = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine().trim());\\n        // We will reuse two boolean arrays up to size 2^18.\\n        final int MAXC = 18;\\n        final int MAXMASK = 1 << MAXC;\\n        boolean[] bad = new boolean[MAXMASK];\\n        boolean[] invalid = new boolean[MAXMASK];\\n\\n        while (t-- > 0) {\\n            String[] parts = br.readLine().split(\\\" \\\");\\n            int n = Integer.parseInt(parts[0]);\\n            int c = Integer.parseInt(parts[1]);\\n            int k = Integer.parseInt(parts[2]);\\n            String s = br.readLine().trim();\\n\\n            int fullMask = (1 << c) - 1;\\n            int Msize = 1 << c;  // we'll only use [0..Msize-1]\\n            \\n            // Clear bad[] and invalid[] up to Msize\\n            for (int m = 0; m < Msize; m++) {\\n                bad[m] = false;\\n                invalid[m] = false;\\n            }\\n\\n            // Build the windows of length k (or if k > n, just the whole string once).\\n            int[] freq = new int[c];\\n            int windowMask = 0;\\n\\n            if (k >= n) {\\n                // Only one window: the entire string [0..n-1]\\n                for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\\n                    int letter = s.charAt(i) - 'A';\\n                    if (++freq[letter] == 1) {\\n                        windowMask |= (1 << letter);\\n                    }\\n                }\\n                int A = fullMask ^ windowMask;\\n                bad[A] = true;\\n            } else {\\n                // Build first window [0..k-1]\\n                for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {\\n                    int letter = s.charAt(i) - 'A';\\n                    if (++freq[letter] == 1) {\\n                        windowMask |= (1 << letter);\\n                    }\\n                }\\n                // Slide from i=0..n-k\\n                bad[fullMask ^ windowMask] = true;\\n                for (int i = 1; i <= n - k; i++) {\\n                    // remove s[i-1], add s[i+k-1]\\n                    int oldLet = s.charAt(i - 1) - 'A';\\n                    if (--freq[oldLet] == 0) {\\n                        windowMask &= ~(1 << oldLet);\\n                    }\\n                    int newLet = s.charAt(i + k - 1) - 'A';\\n                    if (++freq[newLet] == 1) {\\n                        windowMask |= (1 << newLet);\\n                    }\\n                    bad[fullMask ^ windowMask] = true;\\n                }\\n            }\\n\\n            // Also enforce final‐letter constraint: s[n-1] must be in E\\n            int lastLetter = s.charAt(n - 1) - 'A';\\n            int Aend = fullMask ^ (1 << lastLetter);\\n            bad[Aend] = true;\\n\\n            // Mark all submasks of a bad mask as invalid\\n            for (int A = 0; A < Msize; A++) {\\n                if (bad[A]) {\\n                    // iterate all submasks of A\\n                    int sub = A;\\n                    do {\\n                        invalid[sub] = true;\\n                        sub = (sub - 1) & A;\\n                    } while (sub != A);\\n                }\\n            }\\n\\n            // Scan for the valid mask with minimal popcount\\n            int answer = c;  // at worst, we need all c letters\\n            for (int m = 0; m < Msize; m++) {\\n                if (!invalid[m]) {\\n                    int pc = Integer.bitCount(m);\\n                    if (pc < answer) {\\n                        answer = pc;\\n                        if (answer == 0) break; // can't do better than 0\\n                    }\\n                }\\n            }\\n\\n            out.println(answer);\\n        }\\n\\n        out.flush();\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Explanation of Key Steps**\\n\\n1. **Windows & “bad” masks**  \\n   We slide a window of length \\\\(k\\\\) over the string \\\\(s\\\\).  For each window we compute the bitmask \\\\(M\\\\) of letters present; its complement \\\\(A = (\\\\text{all-ones})\\\\oplus M\\\\) is the set of *forbidden* letters (those not appearing in the window).  If we chose an ending‐set \\\\(E\\\\subseteq A\\\\), then \\\\(E\\\\) would have no letter in the window, so we could not cut a word there.  Hence every \\\\(E\\\\subseteq A\\\\) is invalid; we mark `bad[A] = true`.\\n\\n2. **Final‐letter requirement**  \\n   Even if all length-\\\\(k\\\\) windows have a cut possibility, to cover the final (shorter) tail \\\\((\\\\le k\\\\)) we *must* end on \\\\(s_n\\\\).  Thus we also mark the single-letter window \\\\(\\\\{s_n\\\\}\\\\) in the same fashion.\\n\\n3. **Submask sweeping**  \\n   Once we know which coarse masks `bad[A]` occur, *any* submask of such an \\\\(A\\\\) is also invalid.  We enumerate all submasks of each such \\\\(A\\\\) by the standard  `for (sub=A; ; sub=(sub-1)&A)` trick.\\n\\n4. **Min‐popcount**  \\n   Finally we scan all masks \\\\(0\\\\ldots2^c-1\\\\), ignore those marked invalid, and keep the minimum bit‐count.  That is our answer.\\n\\nBecause \\\\(c\\\\le18\\\\) the mask‐size \\\\(2^c\\\\) is at most about \\\\(2.6\\\\times10^5\\\\).  The total work over all test cases is comfortably within the limits.\",\n        \"refusal\": null,\n        \"role\": \"assistant\",\n        \"annotations\": [],\n        \"audio\": null,\n        \"function_call\": null,\n        \"tool_calls\": null\n      },\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"protected_material_code\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"protected_material_text\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"created\": 1753310444,\n  \"model\": \"o4-mini-2025-04-16\",\n  \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n  \"service_tier\": null,\n  \"system_fingerprint\": null,\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"completion_tokens\": 9444,\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 573,\n    \"total_tokens\": 10017,\n    \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n      \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"reasoning_tokens\": 7232,\n      \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n    },\n    \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"cached_tokens\": 0\n    }\n  },\n  \"prompt_filter_results\": [\n    {\n      \"prompt_index\": 0,\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"jailbreak\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
