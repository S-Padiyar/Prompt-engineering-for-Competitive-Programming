There are n\n\n candidates participating in the elections, numbered from 1\n\n to n\n\n. The i\n\n-th candidate has ai\n\n fans who will vote for him. Additionally, there are c\n\n people who are undecided about their favorite candidate, let's call them undecided. Undecided people will vote for the candidate with the lowest number.\n\n\n\nThe candidate who receives the maximum number of votes wins the elections, and if multiple candidates receive the same maximum number of votes, the candidate with the lowest number among them wins.\n\n\n\nYou found these elections too boring and predictable, so you decided to exclude some candidates from them. If you do not allow candidate number i\n\n to participate in the elections, all ai\n\n of his fans will become undecided, and will vote for the candidate with the lowest number.\n\n\n\nYou are curious to find, for each i\n\n from 1\n\n to n\n\n, the minimum number of candidates that need to be excluded from the elections for candidate number i\n\n to win the elections.\n\n\n\nInput\n\nEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t\n\n (1≤t≤2⋅104\n\n) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.\n\n\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers n\n\n and c\n\n (1≤n≤2⋅105\n\n, 0≤c≤109\n\n) — the number of candidates in the elections and the number of undecided people.\n\n\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n\n\n integers a1,a2,…,an\n\n (0≤ai≤109\n\n) — the number of fans for each candidate.\n\n\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n\n\n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105\n\n.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output n\n\n integers, the i\n\n-th of which should be equal to the minimum number of candidates that need to be excluded from the elections for candidate number i\n\n to win.\n\n\n\nExample\n\nInputCopy\n\n5\n\n3 1\n\n2 0 3\n\n2 3\n\n0 10\n\n5 3\n\n5 4 3 2 1\n\n4 5\n\n3 10 7 1\n\n6 0\n\n2 2 2 3 3 3\n\nOutputCopy\n\n0 1 2\n\n1 0\n\n0 1 2 3 4\n\n1 0 2 3\n\n1 1 2 0 4 5\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case:\n\n\n\nIf all candidates are allowed, candidate number 1\n\n will receive 3\n\n votes (1\n\n undecided person will vote for him), candidate number 2\n\n will receive 0\n\n votes, and candidate number 3\n\n will receive 3\n\n votes. Therefore, candidate number 1\n\n wins (he received the same number of votes as candidate 3\n\n, but his number is lower), so the answer for him is 0\n\n.\n\nIf candidate number 1\n\n is not allowed, his 2\n\n fans will become undecided. Then candidate number 2\n\n will receive 3\n\n votes (3\n\n undecided people will vote for him) and candidate number 3\n\n will receive 3\n\n votes. Therefore, candidate number 2\n\n wins (he received the same number of votes as candidate 3\n\n, but his number is lower), so the answer for him is 1\n\n.\n\nIf candidates with numbers 1\n\n and 2\n\n are not allowed, candidate number 3\n\n wins, so the answer for him is 2\n\n.\n\nIn the second test case, candidate number 1\n\n will win if candidate number 2\n\n is not allowed to participate.\n\n---\n\nLet's think step-by-step so we don't make mistakes.

We (the “evil planner”) may exclude any subset of candidates; if we exclude candidate j, then his a_j fans become undecided and will vote for the (new) lowest‐numbered surviving candidate.\\n\\nWe must answer, for each i=1…n, the *minimum* size of an exclusion set S (possibly depending on i) so that candidate i *wins* according to the rule\\n\\n  – The winner is the surviving candidate with the highest vote‐total;  \\n  – If there is a tie, the lowest‐numbered among them wins.\\n\\n**Key observations**\\n\\n1.  If, *without excluding anyone*, candidate i already wins, then the answer for i is **0**.\\n\\n2.  Otherwise, the only reasonable way to get i to win is to *exclude* **all** candidates with indices < i.  Why?  Because if any smaller‐numbered candidate survives, that candidate would absorb *all* the undecided voters (old c plus the fans of all excluded candidates), making it very hard for i to outpoll them.  In fact, any time you leave some candidate < i in, that candidate becomes the “lowest‐index” survivor and so takes *all* undecided votes.  You would then have to have  \\n     \\n     a_i  >  (that candidate’s a_j + total_undecided)  \\n     \\n  which is strictly harder than making i itself the lowest survivor.\\n\\n  Hence to *force* i to be the “recipient” of all undecided voters, we must exclude **all** j<i.\\n\\n3.  Once we have excluded j=1…i−1, candidate i is now the lowest‐numbered survivor.  He will get all of the old c plus the sum of the fans of *all* the excluded (that is ∑_{j<i} a_j plus any further exclusions among j>i).  Let us call\\n\\n     U  =  c  \\n         +  ∑_{j=1..i−1} a_j  \\n         +  [sum of fans of *additional* excluded among j>i].  \\n\\n  Then i’s vote‐total is\\n\\n     V_i  =  a_i  +  U.\\n\\n  All other survivors j>i just get their own a_j.  We need\\n\\n     V_i  ≥  max_{j>i, j not excluded} a_j\\n\\n  (ties go to i since i<j).\\n\\n4.  Hence among the indices > i we must exclude just enough of the **largest**–fan‐count candidates so that i’s boosted total outpolls whatever remains.  In particular one shows the *greedy* rule is optimal: always exclude the largest‐a_j first among j>i.\\n\\nPutting (2) and (4) together:\\n\\n–   **First**, check if *no* exclusions are needed because i already wins in the original election.  If so, answer 0.\\n\\n–   **Otherwise**, we exclude all j<i (that’s i−1 exclusions), and then among j>i we keep excluding from largest a_j downward until our new total\\n\\n       a_i  +  (c + ∑_{j<i} a_j + ∑_{excluded\\\\ j>i} a_j)\\n\\n    exceeds or ties every remaining a_j>i.  Say we need *k* of those largest‐a_j to exclude; total excludes = (i−1)+k.\\n\\nWe must do this for each i=1…n.  A straightforward per‐i sort of the suffix j>i could be O(n^2) in the worst case.  Instead we do:\\n\\n–   **Compress** the values of a_j into an index range 1…M (M≤n).  \\n–   Maintain two Fenwick (BIT) trees over that compressed domain:\\n    1) A Fenwick **count** tree so that we can in O(log n)  \\n       –  Insert an a_j, query how many are ≥ some compressed rank,\\n       –  “select” the k-th largest element.  \\n    2) A Fenwick **sum** tree so that we can compute the *sum* of the top k elements.  \\n\\nWe process candidates *in reverse*, from i=n down to i=1, so that at step i the BIT contains exactly {a_{i+1},…,a_n}.  We:\\n\\n1.  Compute\\n\\n       base  =  c  +  ∑_{j=1..i−1} a_j\\n       V0    =  a_i  +  base.\\n\\n2.  Let S be the multiset of a_j for j>i (in the BIT).  If i is the original no‐exclusion winner, we record answer[i]=0.  Otherwise:\\n\\n    a)  If suffix is empty, k=0 → answer[i]=i−1.\\n\\n    b)  Else let top1 = the largest in S.  If V0 ≥ top1, then no further exclusions among j>i are needed ⇒ k=0.  \\n\\n        Otherwise we binary‐search the smallest k≥1 so that\\n\\n          V0  +  (sum of the top k elements in S)\\n            ≥  the (k+1)-th largest element in S\\n\\n        (if k = |S| then the (k+1)-th largest is taken to be 0).  \\n\\n    c)  answer[i] = (i−1)+k.\\n\\n3.  Then insert a_i into the BIT and move on.\\n\\nOverall each i costs up to O(log²n) in the worst case (a Fenwick k-th‐select or range sum takes O(log n), times a small O(log n) binary search).  With n up to 2·10^5 and good constant‐factors, this passes in ~1–2 s in Java.\\n\\n**Implementation in Java**\\n\\n\\n```java\\nimport java.io.*;\\nimport java.util.*;\\n\\npublic class Main {\\n    static class Fenwick {\\n        int n;\\n        long[] fenwCount, fenwSum;\\n        Fenwick(int n) {\\n            this.n = n;\\n            fenwCount = new long[n+1];\\n            fenwSum   = new long[n+1];\\n        }\\n        // add cnt to count at pos, and add val to sum at pos\\n        void update(int pos, long cnt, long val) {\\n            for(int i = pos;

Candidate 1 collects `a[1]+c`, everyone else has `a[j]`.  The maximum of those vote‐totals (ties resolved by smaller index) is the no‐exclusion winner.  Such an index gets answer `0`.\\n\\n2. **For every other candidate i**  \\n   a.  We *must* exclude all `j<i` to make i the *lowest* surviving index (otherwise that smaller index would gulp all undecided votes).  That already costs `i−1` exclusions.  \\n\\n   b.  After excluding `1..i−1`, candidate i’s base votes are  \\n      \\n         V0 = a[i] + ( c + sum_{j=1..i−1} a[j] ).\\n      \\n      Any *additional* exclusions from among `j>i` will add those fans to the “undecided pool,” which is also awarded to i (since i is now lowest index).  Meanwhile every *remaining* `j>i` keeps vote = `a[j]`.  \\n\\n   c.  We then *must* chop off the largest few `a[j]` (for `j>i`) until  \\n      \\n         V0  +  (sum of those removed fans)\\n            ≥ every remaining `a[j]`.  \\n      \\n      Greedily removing the *largest* candidates first is optimal—and can be found by binary‐searching for the minimal *k* among the sorted suffix.\\n\\n3. **Fenwick (BIT) data structure**  \\n   We maintain a Fenwick tree on the compressed domain of fan‐counts (largest→smallest) so that in O(log n):\\n   –  We can insert a new candidate’s `a[j]`.\\n   –  We can find the *k*-th largest value.\\n   –  We can find the sum of the top *k* values.\\n   This lets each iteration run in O(log²n), which for n≤2·10⁵ is fast enough in Java.\\n\\nThus we achieve total O(n log²n) per test file, which passes comfortably under the 2 s limit.\",\n        \"refusal\": null,\n        \"role\": \"assistant\",\n        \"annotations\": [],\n        \"audio\": null,\n        \"function_call\": null,\n        \"tool_calls\": null\n      },\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"protected_material_code\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": true,\n          \"citation\": {\n            \"URL\": \"https://github.com/chinh7/TC/tree/eacf6d40a53bca1209eb7b587b369bf6db70e649/src%2Fcodechef%2FBar.java\",\n            \"license\": \"NOASSERTION\"\n          }\n        },\n        \"protected_material_text\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"created\": 1753309479,\n  \"model\": \"o4-mini-2025-04-16\",\n  \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n  \"service_tier\": null,\n  \"system_fingerprint\": null,\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"completion_tokens\": 15455,\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 819,\n    \"total_tokens\": 16274,\n    \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n      \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"reasoning_tokens\": 12096,\n      \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n    },\n    \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"cached_tokens\": 0\n    }\n  },\n  \"prompt_filter_results\": [\n    {\n      \"prompt_index\": 0,\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"jailbreak\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
