Turtle and an Incomplete Sequence\n\ntime limit per test3 seconds\n\nmemory limit per test256 megabytes\n\nTurtle was playing with a sequence a1,a2,…,an\n\n consisting of positive integers. Unfortunately, some of the integers went missing while playing.\n\n\n\nNow the sequence becomes incomplete. There may exist an arbitrary number of indices i\n\n such that ai\n\n becomes −1\n\n. Let the new sequence be a′\n\n.\n\n\n\nTurtle is sad. But Turtle remembers that for every integer i\n\n from 1\n\n to n−1\n\n, either ai=⌊ai+12⌋\n\n or ai+1=⌊ai2⌋\n\n holds for the original sequence a\n\n.\n\n\n\nTurtle wants you to help him complete the sequence. But sometimes Turtle makes mistakes, so you need to tell him if you can't complete the sequence.\n\n\n\nFormally, you need to find another sequence b1,b2,…,bn\n\n consisting of positive integers such that:\n\n\n\nFor every integer i\n\n from 1\n\n to n\n\n, if a′i≠−1\n\n, then bi=a′i\n\n.\n\nFor every integer i\n\n from 1\n\n to n−1\n\n, either bi=⌊bi+12⌋\n\n or bi+1=⌊bi2⌋\n\n holds.\n\nFor every integer i\n\n from 1\n\n to n\n\n, 1≤bi≤109\n\n.\n\nIf there is no sequence b1,b2,…,bn\n\n that satisfies all of the conditions above, you need to report −1\n\n.\n\n\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t\n\n (1≤t≤105\n\n). The description of the test cases follows.\n\n\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer n\n\n (2≤n≤2⋅105\n\n) — the length of the sequence.\n\n\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n\n\n integers a′1,a′2,…,a′n\n\n (a′i=−1\n\n or 1≤a′i≤108\n\n) — the elements of the sequence a′\n\n.\n\n\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n\n\n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105\n\n.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, if there is no sequence b1,b2,…,bn\n\n that satisfies all of the conditions, output a single integer −1\n\n.\n\n\n\nOtherwise, output n\n\n integers b1,b2,…,bn\n\n — the elements of the sequence b1,b2,…,bn\n\n you find. The sequence should satisfy that 1≤bi≤109\n\n for every integer i\n\n from 1\n\n to n\n\n.

First, carefully read and restate the problem in your own words to ensure full understanding. Identify the input and output formats, list the constraints, and consider any edge cases that might affect the logic. Next, determine which algorithmic pattern the problem fits best—such as greedy, binary search, two pointers, dynamic programming, or graph traversal—and briefly explain why that pattern applies. Then, plan your solution step by step, describing the key ideas, data structures, or mathematical insights you’ll use. Once your plan is clear, write a clean and fully working Java program. Use import java.util.*; and include a Main class with a main method, using Scanner or BufferedReader for input depending on the constraints. Add comments to explain important logic in the code. After coding, walk through a sample input manually to show how your solution works in practice. Finally, analyze the time and space complexity of your approach using Big-O notation, justifying your answer. Think step by step and only write code once the logic is sound and complete."

We want to fill in the \\\\(-1\\\\) positions to obtain a positive array \\\\(b\\\\) (all \\\\(1 \\\\le b_i \\\\le 10^9\\\\)) such that:\\n\\n1.

Otherwise print any valid \\\\(b\\\\).\\n\\n**Key Observation**  \\nDefine a graph on the positive integers where each positive integer \\\\(x\\\\) has edges\\n- to its “parent” \\\\(\\\\lfloor x/2\\\\rfloor\\\\) (if that is \\\\(\\\\ge1\\\\)), and\\n- to its two “children” \\\\(2x\\\\) and \\\\(2x+1\\\\) (provided they do not exceed \\\\(10^9\\\\)).\\n\\nOne checks easily that an edge \\\\((x,y)\\\\) in this graph is exactly a pair that satisfies \\n\\\\[\\nx = \\\\lfloor y/2\\\\rfloor\\\\quad\\\\text{or}\\\\quad y = \\\\lfloor x/2\\\\rfloor,\\n\\\\]\\nand the problem’s adjacency condition is exactly that consecutive \\\\(b_i\\\\) must be adjacent in that infinite binary‐tree graph.\\n\\nTherefore any “chunk” of the array between two *known* anchors \\\\(a_i\\\\neq -1\\\\) and \\\\(a_j\\\\neq -1\\\\) must realize a walk in this graph of length \\\\(j-i\\\\).  In a tree, the shortest path length between two nodes \\\\(u,v\\\\) is \\n\\\\[\\n\\\\mathsf{dist}(u,v) \\\\;=\\\\; \\\\text{(number of up‐edges)} + \\\\text{(number of down‐edges)}.\\n\\\\]\\nSince we can always insert back‐and‐forth loops of length 2 (e.g.\\\\ \\\\(x\\\\to 2x\\\\to x\\\\)), one can lengthen any walk beyond the minimum, by any even number.  Hence feasibility between two known anchors \\\\((i,u)\\\\) and \\\\((j,v)\\\\) is\\n\\n1. \\\\(j-i \\\\ge \\\\mathsf{dist}(u,v)\\\\), and  \\n2. \\\\((\\\\,j-i - \\\\mathsf{dist}(u,v)\\\\,)\\\\bmod 2 = 0.\\\\)\\n\\nAt the two ends (before the first known anchor, and after the last), there is no fixed endpoint, so we can choose an appropriate “virtual anchor” to match parity and length constraints, and we again solve a “between‐anchors” problem in the same way.\\n\\n**Solution Outline**\\n\\n1. Read the input array \\\\(a'\\\\).  Collect the indices of the *known* entries in a list `pos`.  \\n2. If `pos` is empty (all entries missing), one simple valid fill is\\n   \\\\[\\n     b_i = \\n       \\\\begin{cases}\\n         1,& i\\\\text{ odd},\\\\\\\\[6pt]\\n         2,& i\\\\text{ even},\\n       \\\\end{cases}\\n   \\\\]\\n   because \\\\((1,2)\\\\) and \\\\((2,1)\\\\) each satisfy the adjacency rule.  \\n3. Otherwise:\\n\\n   a. **Precheck** each consecutive pair of known anchors \\\\((i, a'_i)\\\\), \\\\((j, a'_j)\\\\).  \\n      Compute the shortest‐path distance \\\\(\\\\mathsf{dist}(a'_i,a'_j)\\\\) in the binary‐tree graph (by climbing to LCA), and verify \\\\(j-i \\\\ge \\\\mathsf{dist}\\\\) and same parity.  If any check fails, print \\\\(-1\\\\) and move on to the next test case.  \\n   \\n   b. **Fill segments** one by one with a function `fillSegment(lpos,lval,rpos,rval)` that constructs a walk of length `gap = rpos - lpos` from `lval` to `rval`, padding with 2‐cycles \\\\((x\\\\to 2x\\\\to x)\\\\) at the start as needed to match the exact length.  \\n   \\n   c. **Before the first known** and **after the last known**, we create appropriate “virtual anchors” so that the gap and parity match, then call the same `fillSegment` procedure and write into the array.  \\n\\n4.

We allow padding by back‐and‐forth loops of length 2, so any even surplus beyond the shortest distance is also realizable.  \\n- At the array boundaries (before the first known, after the last known) we introduce a “virtual anchor” chosen so that length & parity match, then use the very same segment‐filling machinery.  \\n- If no known anchors exist at all, we simply alternate \\\\(\\\\;1,2,1,2,\\\\dots\\\\), which trivially satisfies every adjacency.\\n\\n**Complexity**  \\n- Each test:  \\n  - We do at most \\\\(O(n)\\\\) segments.  \\n  - Computing \\\\(\\\\mathsf{dist}\\\\) and a base path between two values \\\\(\\\\le 10^8\\\\) costs \\\\(O(\\\\log(\\\\max a_i))\\\\).  \\n  - Walking and writing out at most \\\\(O(n)\\\\) entries.  \\n- Overall \\\\(O\\\\bigl(\\\\sum n\\\\cdot \\\\log(\\\\max a_i)\\\\bigr)\\\\), well within the \\\\(2\\\\times10^5\\\\) total constraint.\",\n        \"refusal\": null,\n        \"role\": \"assistant\",\n        \"annotations\": [],\n        \"audio\": null,\n        \"function_call\": null,\n        \"tool_calls\": null\n      },\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"protected_material_code\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"protected_material_text\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"created\": 1753326410,\n  \"model\": \"o4-mini-2025-04-16\",\n  \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n  \"service_tier\": null,\n  \"system_fingerprint\": null,\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"completion_tokens\": 18616,\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 1129,\n    \"total_tokens\": 19745,\n    \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n      \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"reasoning_tokens\": 15296,\n      \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n    },\n    \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"cached_tokens\": 1024\n    }\n  },\n  \"prompt_filter_results\": [\n    {\n      \"prompt_index\": 0,\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"jailbreak\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
