Concretely, if in your subarray you have\\n\\n```\\n … v … u … v … u …\\n```\\n\\n(with indices `i < k < j < l` and `a[i]=a[j]=v`, `a[k]=a[l]=u`), then you cannot ever remove all `u` or all `v` as a single contiguous block.  Conversely, *if* no two values’ occurrence‐intervals *partially overlap* in that way, then one can always peel off the intervals in a nested/disjoint order (always remove an innermost interval first).\\n\\nWe must answer up to \\\\(2\\\\times10^5\\\\) queries on total array‐length up to \\\\(2\\\\times10^5\\\\), so \\\\(O(nq)\\\\) is too big.  Instead, we precompute for each possible start position \\\\(`L`\\\\) the *furthest* right endpoint \\\\(`R[L]`\\\\) such that **every** subarray \\\\([L..x]\\\\) with \\\\(x \\\\le R[L]\\\\) is valid (i.e.\\\\ *orangutan-approved*), and for any larger \\\\(x\\\\) it first becomes invalid.\\n\\nThen answering a query \\\\([l..r]\\\\) is simply checking\\n\\n```\\n   R[l] ≥ r  ?  “YES” : “NO”\\n```\\n\\nHow do we build the array `R[1..n]` in about \\\\(O(n\\\\log n)\\\\)?  One can show that the only “obstructions” come from pairs of *adjacent* occurrences of the same value in the *whole* array.  If a value \\\\(v\\\\) appears at positions\\n\\\\[\\n   p_1 < p_2 < \\\\dots < p_k,\\n\\\\]\\nwe look at the \\\\(k-1\\\\) “adjacent‐occurrence intervals”\\n\\\\[\\n   [p_1,p_2],\\\\; [p_2,p_3],\\\\;\\\\dots,\\\\;[p_{k-1},p_k].\\n\\\\]\\nCall each such an interval \\\\(I_i = [\\\\ell_i,r_i]\\\\).\\n\\nTwo such intervals \\\\(I=[\\\\ell,r]\\\\) and \\\\(J=[\\\\ell',r']\\\\) **conflict** (i.e.\\\\ cause a forbidden pattern) exactly if\\n\\\\[\\n    \\\\ell < \\\\ell' < r < r'.\\n\\\\]\\nIn that case, *any* subarray that contains \\\\(\\\\ell\\\\) through \\\\(r'\\\\) becomes invalid.\\n\\nWe proceed in two steps:\\n\\n1.  **List all the “base” intervals**  \\n    For each position `i` we precompute `nxt[i] =` the index of the next occurrence of `a[i]` to the right (or 0 if none).  \\n    Then every `i` with `nxt[i]>0` gives us one interval\\n    \\\\[\\n      I = [\\\\,i,\\\\; \\\\text{nxt}[i]\\\\,].\\n    \\\\]\\n\\n2.  **For each interval \\\\(I_1=[\\\\ell,r]\\\\) find the minimal \\\\(r'\\\\) of any conflicting \\\\(I_2=[\\\\ell',r']\\\\).**  \\n    We sort *all* intervals in **descending** order of their right endpoint.  Call that list `INTS[0..m-1]`.  \\n    We will sweep through it to build an auxiliary segment tree.\\n\\n    -  We maintain a segment‐tree `st` over the *start*–coordinate \\\\(\\\\ell\\\\in[1..n]\\\\).  At any moment it holds *exactly* those intervals `J=[\\\\ell',r']` whose `r'` is *strictly greater* than the current query‐interval's right endpoint.  We store in `st` at position `ell'` the value `r'`.\\n\\n    -  Then when we look at a given interval `I1 = [ℓ1,r1]`, we have already inserted into `st` all intervals with `r2>r1`.  We want to find among them those whose start `ℓ2` satisfies\\n       \\\\[\\n         \\\\ell_1 < \\\\ell_2 < r_1,\\n       \\\\]\\n      and we need the *minimal* `r2` among those.  If that minimal `r2` is, say, `bad`, then any subarray starting at `ℓ1` and going to ≥`bad` is invalid.  We record\\n       ```\\n       best[ℓ1] = min( best[ℓ1], bad ).\\n       ```\\n\\n    By processing intervals in descending order of `r1`, we can keep a pointer `p2` walking through the same array (also descending in `r2`), inserting into the segment tree exactly those intervals whose `r2 > r1` just before we handle `I1`.\\n\\n    After we fill `best[1..n]`, we do one more pass from right to left building\\n    ```\\n      forbidR[L] = min( best[L], best[L+1], best[L+2], …, best[n] )\\n    ```\\n    and then set\\n    ```\\n      R[L] = (forbidR[L] == INF ? n : forbidR[L]–1).\\n    ```\\n\\nThat precomputation takes \\\\(O(n\\\\log n)\\\\) for the sorts and \\\\(O(n\\\\log n)\\\\) for the segment‐tree–insertions and queries.

If it exists, that yields an “interval” \\\\([\\\\;i,\\\\;nxt[i]\\\\;]\\\\).  These intervals capture *exactly* the potential “blocks” of equal values that must be removed in one go.\\n\\n2. **Detecting conflicts**  \\n   Two such intervals \\\\([\\\\ell,r]\\\\) and \\\\([\\\\ell',r']\\\\) *partially overlap* (i.e.\\\\ conflict) iff\\n   \\\\[\\n     \\\\ell < \\\\ell' < r < r'\\\\,.\\n   \\\\]\\n   Any subarray containing \\\\(\\\\ell\\\\) through \\\\(r'\\\\) is then *not* orangutan‐approved.\\n\\n3. **Precomputing earliest invalid endpoint**  \\n   We sort *all* these intervals by descending \\\\(r\\\\).  Then we sweep through them in that order.  We keep a segment‐tree indexed by the *start*–coordinate \\\\(\\\\ell\\\\).  At step when handling an interval \\\\(I_1=[\\\\ell_1,r_1]\\\\) we insert **all** intervals whose right‐endpoint \\\\(r_2\\\\) is strictly greater than \\\\(r_1\\\\).  In the tree at position \\\\(\\\\ell_2\\\\) we store \\\\(r_2\\\\).  Then to find the *tightest* conflict with \\\\(I_1\\\\) we query the segment‐tree on the range of starts\\n   \\\\[\\n     (\\\\ell_1,\\\\,r_1)\\\\quad\\\\longrightarrow\\\\quad[\\\\ell_1+1,\\\\;r_1-1]\\n   \\\\]\\n   for the *minimum* stored \\\\(r_2\\\\).  If that minimum is, say, `badR`, it means `I2=[ℓ2,badR]` is the earliest conflict interval, so *any* superarray starting at `ℓ1` and ending at ≥ `badR` fails.  We record\\n   ```java\\n     best[ℓ1] = min(best[ℓ1], badR);\\n   ```\\n\\n4. **From per-interval to per-start**  \\n   Since multiple base‐intervals may share the same start `ℓ1`, we keep the minimum “badR” among them in `best[ℓ1]`.  \\n   Finally we do a suffix‐minimum scan\\n   ```\\n     forbidR[L] = min( best[L], best[L+1], …, best[n-1] )\\n   ```\\n   and set\\n   ```\\n     R[L] = (forbidR[L] == INF ? n-1 : forbidR[L]-1).\\n   ```\\n   Thus *any* subarray `[L..x]` with `x ≤ R[L]` is valid, and if `x > R[L]` it first becomes invalid.\\n\\n5. **Answer queries**  \\n   A query `[l..r]` is “YES” exactly when `R[l] ≥ r`.\\n\\nThis runs in \\\\(O(n\\\\log n)\\\\) per test case (sorting and segment‐tree updates/queries) and answers each query in \\\\(O(1)\\\\).\",\n        \"refusal\": null,\n        \"role\": \"assistant\",\n        \"annotations\": [],\n        \"audio\": null,\n        \"function_call\": null,\n        \"tool_calls\": null\n      },\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"protected_material_code\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": true,\n          \"citation\": {\n            \"URL\": \"https://github.com/chinh7/TC/tree/eacf6d40a53bca1209eb7b587b369bf6db70e649/src%2Fcodechef%2FBar.java\",\n            \"license\": \"NOASSERTION\"\n          }\n        },\n        \"protected_material_text\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"created\": 1753310876,\n  \"model\": \"o4-mini-2025-04-16\",\n  \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n  \"service_tier\": null,\n  \"system_fingerprint\": null,\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"completion_tokens\": 17642,\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 804,\n    \"total_tokens\": 18446,\n    \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n      \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"reasoning_tokens\": 14464,\n      \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n    },\n    \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"cached_tokens\": 0\n    }\n  },\n  \"prompt_filter_results\": [\n    {\n      \"prompt_index\": 0,\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"jailbreak\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
