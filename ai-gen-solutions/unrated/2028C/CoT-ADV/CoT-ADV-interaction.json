Alice's Adventures in Cutting Cake\n\ntime limit per test2 seconds\n\nmemory limit per test256 megabytes\n\nAlice is at the Mad Hatter's tea party! There is a long sheet cake made up of n\n\n sections with tastiness values a1,a2,…,an\n\n. There are m\n\n creatures at the tea party, excluding Alice.\n\n\n\nAlice will cut the cake into m+1\n\n pieces. Formally, she will partition the cake into m+1\n\n subarrays, where each subarray consists of some number of adjacent sections. The tastiness of a piece is the sum of tastiness of its sections. Afterwards, she will divvy these m+1\n\n pieces up among the m\n\n creatures and herself (her piece can be empty). However, each of the m\n\n creatures will only be happy when the tastiness of its piece is v\n\n or more.\n\n\n\nAlice wants to make sure every creature is happy. Limited by this condition, she also wants to maximize the tastiness of her own piece. Can you help Alice find the maximum tastiness her piece can have? If there is no way to make sure every creature is happy, output −1\n\n.\n\n\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t\n\n (1≤t≤104\n\n). The description of the test cases follows.\n\n\n\nThe first line of each test case contains three integers n,m,v\n\n (1≤m≤n≤2⋅105\n\n; 1≤v≤109\n\n) — the number of sections, the number of creatures, and the creatures' minimum requirement for tastiness, respectively.\n\n\n\nThe next line contains n\n\n space separated integers a1,a2,…,an\n\n (1≤ai≤109\n\n) — the tastinesses of the sections.\n\n\n\nThe sum of n\n\n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105\n\n.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output the maximum tastiness Alice can achieve for her piece, or −1\n\n if there is no way to make sure every creature is happy.\n\n\n\nExample\n\nInputCopy\n\n7\n\n6 2 1\n\n1 1 10 1 1 10\n\n6 2 2\n\n1 1 10 1 1 10\n\n6 2 3\n\n1 1 10 1 1 10\n\n6 2 10\n\n1 1 10 1 1 10\n\n6 2 11\n\n1 1 10 1 1 10\n\n6 2 12\n\n1 1 10 1 1 10\n\n6 2 12\n\n1 1 1 1 10 10\n\nOutputCopy\n\n22\n\n12\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n0\n\n-1\n\nNote\n\nFor the first test case, Alice can give the first and second section as their own pieces, and then take the remaining 10+1+1+10=22\n\n tastiness for herself.

First, carefully read and restate the problem in your own words to ensure full understanding. Identify the input and output formats, list the constraints, and consider any edge cases that might affect the logic. Next, determine which algorithmic pattern the problem fits best—such as greedy, binary search, two pointers, dynamic programming, or graph traversal—and briefly explain why that pattern applies. Then, plan your solution step by step, describing the key ideas, data structures, or mathematical insights you’ll use. Once your plan is clear, write a clean and fully working Java program. Use import java.util.*; and include a Main class with a main method, using Scanner or BufferedReader for input depending on the constraints. Add comments to explain important logic in the code. After coding, walk through a sample input manually to show how your solution works in practice. Finally, analyze the time and space complexity of your approach using Big-O notation, justifying your answer. Think step by step and only write code once the logic is sound and complete."

There are m creatures, each requiring a contiguous piece of cake whose total tastiness is at least v.  Alice will make exactly m + 1 contiguous pieces (by placing m cuts among the n−1 possible cut‐points); she will give one piece to each creature (order doesn’t matter) and keep the remaining piece for herself (her piece may be empty).  Alice wants every creature to be happy (each gets sum ≥ v) and, under that constraint, maximize the tastiness of the piece she keeps.  If it’s impossible to satisfy all creatures, answer −1.\\n\\n**Constraints**\\n\\n- 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2·10⁵, 1 ≤ v, aᵢ ≤ 10⁹\\n- Sum of n over all test cases ≤ 2·10⁵\\n- Up to 10⁴ test cases\\n\\n**Key Insight and Greedy Approach**\\n\\nBecause all aᵢ are positive, if the beasts (creatures) must each get a segment of total tastiness ≥ v, it is optimal for Alice to let them grab the *shortest possible* qualifying segments, so as to leave the *largest contiguous middle chunk* for herself.  Concretely:\\n\\n1. **From the left** we simulate greedily cutting off segments as soon as their cumulative sum ≥ v.  Record the cut‐off positions  \\n   L₁ < L₂ < … < L_A,  \\n   where Lₖ is the index where the kᵗʰ beast‐piece from the left would end.  We also set L₀ = 0 (no left pieces).\\n\\n2. **From the right** we do the same, scanning backwards and recording  \\n   R₁ > R₂ > … > R_B,  \\n   where Rₖ is the *starting* index of the kᵗʰ beast‐piece from the right (i.e. if you scan right→left, you accumulate and as soon as you reach ≥ v you declare a piece covering [Rₖ..previousCut-1]).  We set R₀ = n+1 (no right pieces).\\n\\nIf in total A + B < m, we cannot supply m creatures at all ⇒ answer −1.\\n\\nOtherwise we try all splits of the form “i pieces from the left, m−i pieces from the right,” for i = 0…m.  We need i ≤ A and (m−i) ≤ B; then the beasts’ segments occupy exactly\\n\\n • [1..Lᵢ]  (i segments, extracted greedily from the left)  \\n • [R_{m−i}..n]  ((m−i) segments, greedily from the right)\\n\\nThese two blocks must be disjoint, i.e.  \\n Lᵢ < R_{m−i}.  \\n\\nThen Alice’s piece is the contiguous middle chunk  \\n [Lᵢ+1 .. R_{m−i}−1],  \\nwhose sum is  \\n pref[R_{m−i}−1] − pref[Lᵢ].  \\n\\nWe take the maximum over all valid i.  If none is valid, answer −1; otherwise output that maximum (possibly zero if the middle chunk is empty).\\n\\nThis runs in O(n) per test (two greedy scans + one linear sweep over i).  Total O(∑n).\\n\\n---\\n\\n```java\\nimport java.io.*;\\nimport java.util.*;\\n\\npublic class Main {\\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\\n        BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));\\n        PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(System.out);\\n\\n        int t = Integer.parseInt(in.readLine().trim());\\n        while (t-- > 0) {\\n            StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(in.readLine());\\n            int n = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\\n            int m = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\\n            long v = Long.parseLong(st.nextToken());\\n\\n            long[] a = new long[n+1];\\n            st = new StringTokenizer(in.readLine());\\n            for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\\n                a[i] = Long.parseLong(st.nextToken());\\n            }\\n\\n            // Prefix sums for fast subarray sum queries\\n            long[] pref = new long[n+1];\\n            for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\\n                pref[i] = pref[i-1] + a[i];\\n            }\\n\\n            // Greedily cut from the left\\n            // L[k] = position where the k-th segment (sum>=v) ends.\\n            ArrayList<Integer> L = new ArrayList<>();\\n            L.add(0);  // L[0] = 0 means \\\"no left segments\\\"\\n            long sum = 0;\\n            for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\\n                sum += a[i];\\n                if (sum >= v) {\\n                    L.add(i);\\n                    sum = 0;\\n                }\\n            }\\n            int A = L.size() - 1;  // number of full segments we got from left\\n\\n            // Greedily cut from the right\\n            // R[k] = starting index of the k-th segment from the right\\n            ArrayList<Integer> R = new ArrayList<>();\\n            R.add(n + 1);  // R[0] = n+1 means \\\"no right segments\\\"\\n            sum = 0;\\n            for (int i = n; i >= 1; i--) {\\n                sum += a[i];\\n                if (sum >= v) {\\n                    R.add(i);\\n                    sum = 0;\\n                }\\n            }\\n            int B = R.size() - 1;  // number of full segments from right\\n\\n            // If even greedily we can't muster m segments total, impossible\\n            if (A + B < m) {\\n                out.println(-1);\\n                continue;\\n            }\\n\\n            // Try splitting beasts segments i from left, m-i from right\\n            long ans = -1;\\n            // i ranges from max(0, m-B) to min(A, m)\\n            int from = Math.max(0, m - B);\\n            int to   = Math.min(A, m);\\n            for (int i = from; i <= to; i++) {\\n                int j = m - i;      // segments from right\\n                int leftEnd  = L.get(i);      // last index used by left beasts\\n                int rightBeg = R.get(j);      // first index used by right beasts\\n                // Beasts regions must be disjoint\\n                if (leftEnd < rightBeg) {\\n                    // Alice's chunk is [leftEnd+1 .. rightBeg-1]\\n                    int lo = leftEnd + 1;\\n                    int hi = rightBeg - 1;\\n                    long candidate = (lo <= hi\\n                                      ? pref[hi] - pref[leftEnd]\\n                                      : 0L);\\n                    if (candidate > ans) ans = candidate;\\n                }\\n            }\\n\\n            out.println(ans);\\n        }\\n\\n        out.flush();\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**How It Works**\\n\\n1. We build a prefix sum `pref[]` so that the sum of any interval `[L..R]` is `pref[R]−pref[L−1]`.\\n2. We greedily peel off segments from the left: keep a running `sum`; whenever it reaches ≥ v, we cut and record that endpoint in `L`.  This yields the *shortest possible* i-th segment for each i.\\n3. Similarly, peel off from the right to get `R`.\\n4. If `A + B < m`, even using all greedy segments there aren’t enough → impossible.\\n5. Otherwise for each way to allocate `i` beasts on the left and `m−i` on the right (so that `i ≤ A` and `m−i ≤ B`), we check that the left block `1…L[i]` and right block `R[m−i]…n` do not overlap (`L[i] < R[m−i]`).  Alice’s piece is the gap between them, from `L[i]+1` to `R[m−i]−1`.  We compute that sum in O(1) via prefix sums and take the maximum.\\n6. If no split is valid, we print `−1`; otherwise we print the maximum (possibly zero).\\n\\n**Complexity**\\n\\n- Building the prefix sums: O(n)\\n- Greedy scan from left: O(n)\\n- Greedy scan from right: O(n)\\n- Trying all i from 0…m: O(m) ⊆ O(n)\\n- Overall per test case: O(n).  \\nSum of n over all tests ≤ 2·10⁵ ⇒ total O(2·10⁵), which easily fits in time.\\n\\nSpace is O(n) for the arrays and lists.\",\n        \"refusal\": null,\n        \"role\": \"assistant\",\n        \"annotations\": [],\n        \"audio\": null,\n        \"function_call\": null,\n        \"tool_calls\": null\n      },\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"protected_material_code\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"protected_material_text\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"created\": 1753326234,\n  \"model\": \"o4-mini-2025-04-16\",\n  \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n  \"service_tier\": null,\n  \"system_fingerprint\": null,\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"completion_tokens\": 20450,\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 937,\n    \"total_tokens\": 21387,\n    \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n      \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"reasoning_tokens\": 18496,\n      \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n    },\n    \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"cached_tokens\": 0\n    }\n  },\n  \"prompt_filter_results\": [\n    {\n      \"prompt_index\": 0,\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"jailbreak\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
