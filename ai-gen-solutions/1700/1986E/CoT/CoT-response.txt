**Analysis**

We have an array a of length n and a positive integer k.  We are allowed to

1.  Permute (shuffle) the array arbitrarily before doing anything.
2.  Perform any number of operations of the form 
       “pick an index i and do a_i ← a_i + k.”

After all operations, we want the array to be a palindrome, i.e.  
bᵢ = b_{n−i+1} for 1 ≤ i ≤ n.

Observe first that after shuffling, what really matters is how we pair the elements into the "left" half and the "right" half.  Every element in position i (in the left half) will become paired with the element in position n−i+1 (in the right half).  If n is odd, one element (the “middle” one) stands alone; it automatically satisfies bₘ = bₘ, so it never forces any operation.

Within a pair of values (x,y), we need to make x and y equal by adding k repeatedly—but only increasing is allowed.  Thus

-  If (x−y) is not a multiple of k, we can never make them equal.
-  If (x−y) is a multiple of k, say x<y and y−x=m·k, the cheapest way is to add k exactly m times to the smaller one.  That costs m operations, and afterwards both are y.

Hence two elements can only pair if they lie in the same residue class (mod k).  Moreover, the cost to pair x and y (with x≤y) is (y−x)/k.

Thus the plan is:

1.  **Group by residue**.  Put each a_i into a bucket indexed by r=i_mod_k = a_i mod k.
2.  **Check feasibility of counts**.  
    -  Each bucket must be paired internally.  If its size is even, that bucket contributes all of its elements to pairs.  
    -  If its size is odd, one element in that bucket must be the “center” of the palindrome (only possible if n is odd), and the rest must pair up.
    -  Hence the total number of buckets with odd size must be exactly n mod 2.  Otherwise answer = −1.
3.  **Within each bucket**, we have a sorted list v₁≤v₂≤…≤v_m of size m.
    -  If m is even, the best way to pair them so as to minimize \sum (v_{2j+1}−v_{2j})/k is simply the adjacent pairing  
         (v₁,v₂), (v₃,v₄), …, (v_{m−1},v_m).
    -  If m is odd, we must leave exactly one element out (to serve as the center); we must choose which one to leave so that the sum of the pairing-costs of the remaining m−1 elements is minimized.  
      This can be done in O(m) time by a small DP:
      
      Let dp_pref[i] = minimal cost to pair up v₁…v_i if i is even (∞ if i is odd), by adjacent pairing.  
      Recurrence:  
        dp_pref[0] = 0  
        for i=1…m:  
          if i is odd, dp_pref[i] = ∞;  
          else dp_pref[i] = dp_pref[i−2] + (v_i−v_{i−1})/k.  
      
      Similarly define a suffix‐DP dp_suf[i] = minimal cost to pair up v_i…v_m if (m−i+1) is even (∞ otherwise).  
      Then if we skip element t (1≤t≤m), total cost = dp_pref[t−1] + dp_suf[t+1].  We take the minimum over all t.
4.  **Sum** the costs of all buckets.  That is the answer.

Overall time is O(n log n) for sorting plus O(n) for the DP/pairs.  We need to watch out for 64-bit sums.

**Explanation of the key steps**

1. We shuffle arbitrarily, so we only care about how to *pair* up the multiset of values.
2. An operation `aᵢ ← aᵢ + k` can only increase a value; two values x,y can become equal iff x≡y (mod k), and then the cost is |x−y|/k (all ops applied to the smaller one).
3. Hence we group by residue mod k.  Within each residue‐class we must pair internally.  If the class size is even, everybody is paired; if odd, one element is left as the center (only one class may be odd, exactly when n is odd).
4. Pairing to minimize \sum|x−y| subject to pairing all but (at most) one element is classic:
   - If even size, the best is sorting and pairing *adjacent* elements.
   - If odd size, we run a small O(m) DP to decide *which* single element to leave unpaired, and again pair the rest adjacently.
5. We sum the costs over all residue‐classes; that is the minimal total number of +k‐operations needed.
