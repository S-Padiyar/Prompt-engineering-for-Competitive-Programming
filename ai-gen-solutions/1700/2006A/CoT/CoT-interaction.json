Each vertex has a value of 0\n\n or 1\n\n.\n\n\n\nLet's consider a leaf of the tree (the vertex 1\n\n is never considered a leaf) and define its weight. Construct a string formed by the values of the vertices on the path starting at the root and ending in this leaf. Then the weight of the leaf is the difference between the number of occurrences of 10\n\n and 01\n\n substrings in it.\n\n\n\nTake the following tree as an example. Green vertices have a value of 1\n\n while white vertices have a value of 0\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's calculate the weight of the leaf 5\n\n: the formed string is 10110\n\n. The number of occurrences of substring 10\n\n is 2\n\n, the number of occurrences of substring 01\n\n is 1\n\n, so the difference is 2−1=1\n\n.\n\nLet's calculate the weight of the leaf 6\n\n: the formed string is 101\n\n. The number of occurrences of substring 10\n\n is 1\n\n, the number of occurrences of substring 01\n\n is 1\n\n, so the difference is 1−1=0\n\n.\n\nThe score of a tree is defined as the number of leaves with non-zero weight in the tree.\n\n\n\nBut the values of some vertices haven't been decided and will be given to you as ?\n\n. Filling the blanks would be so boring, so Iris is going to invite Dora to play a game. On each turn, one of the girls chooses any of the remaining vertices with value ?\n\n and changes its value to 0\n\n or 1\n\n, with Iris going first. The game continues until there are no vertices with value ?\n\n left in the tree. Iris aims to maximize the score of the tree, while Dora aims to minimize that.\n\n\n\nAssuming that both girls play optimally, please determine the final score of the tree.\n\n\n\nInput\n\nEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t\n\n (1≤t≤5⋅104\n\n) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.\n\n\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer n\n\n (2≤n≤105\n\n) — the number of vertices in the tree.\n\n\n\nThe following n−1\n\n lines each contain two integers u\n\n and v\n\n (1≤u,v≤n\n\n) — denoting an edge between vertices u\n\n and v\n\n.\n\n\n\nIt's guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.\n\n\n\nThe last line contains a string s\n\n of length n\n\n. The i\n\n-th character of s\n\n represents the value of vertex i\n\n. It's guaranteed that s\n\n only contains characters 0\n\n, 1\n\n and ?\n\n.\n\n\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n\n\n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2⋅105\n\n.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single integer — the final score of the tree.\n\n\n\nExample\n\nInputCopy\n\n6\n\n4\n\n1 2\n\n1 3\n\n4 1\n\n0101\n\n4\n\n1 2\n\n3 2\n\n2 4\n\n???0\n\n5\n\n1 2\n\n1 3\n\n2 4\n\n2 5\n\n?1?01\n\n6\n\n1 2\n\n2 3\n\n3 4\n\n5 3\n\n3 6\n\n?0????\n\n5\n\n1 2\n\n1 3\n\n1 4\n\n1 5\n\n11?1?\n\n2\n\n2 1\n\n??\n\nOutputCopy\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, all the values of the vertices have been determined. There are three different paths from the root to a leaf:\n\n\n\nFrom vertex 1\n\n to vertex 2\n\n. The string formed by the path is 01\n\n, so the weight of the leaf is 0−1=−1\n\n.\n\nFrom vertex 1\n\n to vertex 3\n\n. The string formed by the path is 00\n\n, so the weight of the leaf is 0−0=0\n\n.\n\nFrom vertex 1\n\n to vertex 4\n\n. The string formed by the path is 01\n\n, so the weight of the leaf is 0−1=−1\n\n.\n\nThus, there are two leaves with non-zero weight, so the score of the tree is 2\n\n.\n\n\n\nIn the second test case, one of the sequences of optimal choices for the two players can be:\n\n\n\nIris chooses to change the value of the vertex 3\n\n to 1\n\n.\n\nDora chooses to change the value of the vertex 1\n\n to 0\n\n.\n\nIris chooses to change the value of the vertex 2\n\n to 0\n\n.\n\nThe final tree is as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe only leaf with non-zero weight is 3\n\n, so the score of the tree is 1\n\n. Note that this may not be the only sequence of optimal choices for Iris and Dora.\n\n---\n\nLet's think step-by-step so we don't make mistakes. Use Java. Avoid syntax errors or infinite loops."

Hence the leaf has nonzero “weight” exactly when its bit differs from the root’s bit.  Equivalently,\\n\\n-  If the root’s bit is \\\\(r\\\\in\\\\{0,1\\\\}\\\\), every leaf whose bit \\\\(\\\\ell\\\\neq r\\\\) contributes 1 to the “score,” and every leaf with \\\\(\\\\ell=r\\\\) contributes 0.  \\n-  Only the root’s bit and the leaves’ bits actually affect the final score.  All other vertices can be ignored (“irrelevant”).\\n\\nWe are given some bits already fixed to `0` or `1` and some that are `?`.  Two players, Iris (who goes first) and Dora, take turns replacing any remaining `?` by `0` or `1`.  Iris tries to **maximize** the number of leaves whose bit differs from the root’s, while Dora tries to **minimize** it.\\n\\nLet\\n\\n- \\\\(f_0\\\\) = the number of _already fixed_ leaves that are `0`,\\n- \\\\(f_1\\\\) = the number of _already fixed_ leaves that are `1`,\\n- \\\\(q\\\\) = the number of leaves whose bit is currently `?`,\\n- `rootQ` = whether the root is `?`,\\n- `U` = the number of _irrelevant_ `?`‐vertices (i.e.\\\\ non-root and non-leaf).\\n\\nWe observe:\\n\\n1.  **If the root is already fixed** to \\\\(r\\\\in\\\\{0,1\\\\}\\\\), then\\n   -  among the fixed leaves, those different from \\\\(r\\\\) already contribute\\n      \\\\[\\n        \\\\bigl(r=0?\\\\;f_1:f_0\\\\bigr)\\n      \\\\]\\n     to the score,\\n   -  among the \\\\(q\\\\) as-yet-unknown leaves, Iris and Dora will alternate assigning them.  Whenever Iris assigns a leaf (on her turn) she can set it to \\\\(\\\\ne r\\\\) and thus guarantee that leaf will later count as 1; whenever Dora assigns a leaf, she will set it to \\\\(=r\\\\), guaranteeing that leaf counts 0.  \\n   -  Since Iris starts (and neither player has any incentive to waste a leaf‐assignment turn by picking an irrelevant vertex), of the \\\\(q\\\\) leaf turns Iris will get \\\\(\\\\lceil q/2\\\\rceil\\\\) moves and Dora \\\\(\\\\lfloor q/2\\\\rfloor\\\\).  Hence the total extra from the `?` leaves is \\\\(\\\\lceil q/2\\\\rceil\\\\).\\n   \\n   Therefore if the root is fixed to \\\\(r\\\\), the final score is\\n   \\\\[\\n     \\\\bigl(r=0?\\\\;f_1:f_0\\\\bigr)\\\\;+\\\\;\\\\lceil q/2\\\\rceil.\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n2.  **If the root is `?`**, then _whoever_ first chooses to assign the root will choose the bit \\\\(r\\\\) that best serves her goal:\\n   -  If Iris picks the root, she sets \\\\(r\\\\) to maximize the mismatches among the _already fixed_ leaves, i.e.\\\\ \\n     \\\\(\\\\max(f_0,f_1)\\\\).\\n   -  If Dora picks the root, she sets \\\\(r\\\\) to minimize the mismatches among the fixed leaves, i.e.\\\\ \\n     \\\\(\\\\min(f_0,f_1)\\\\).\\n\\n   After the root is assigned, the remaining \\\\(q\\\\) leaves are assigned alternatingly, _starting_ with the other player.  Whenever Iris assigns a leaf she can force it to differ from \\\\(r\\\\) (so that leaf contributes 1); whenever Dora assigns a leaf she sets it equal to \\\\(r\\\\) (leaf contributes 0).  Hence in those \\\\(q\\\\) assignments Iris will pick \\\\(\\\\lfloor q/2\\\\rfloor\\\\) or \\\\(\\\\lceil q/2\\\\rceil\\\\) leaves depending on whether she moves second or first among those \\\\(q\\\\).\\n\\n   Finally, whether Iris can arrange to _start_ the “relevant” game (the root + leaves) herself or force Dora to start depends on whether there is at least one irrelevant `?` in the tree.  If there is at least one irrelevant `?`, Iris can “burn” one turn on that irrelevant vertex and thereby flip which player takes the first _relevant_ (root-or-leaf) move.  If there are no irrelevant `?`, then the relevant game must begin with Iris’s turn.\\n\\nPutting it all together, one derives the following formula:\\n\\n1.  Count\\n    -  \\\\(f_0\\\\)= # of fixed-zero leaves,\\n    -  \\\\(f_1\\\\)= # of fixed-one leaves,\\n    -  \\\\(q\\\\)= # of leaves that are `?`,\\n    -  `rootQ` = (root==`?`),\\n    -  `U` = total number of `?` in the tree minus \\\\((\\\\text{rootQ}?1:0)\\\\) minus \\\\(q\\\\).  \\n2.  If the root is **fixed** to \\\\(r\\\\), the answer is\\n    \\\\[\\n      \\\\bigl(r=0?\\\\;f_1:f_0\\\\bigr)\\\\;+\\\\;\\\\Bigl\\\\lceil \\\\tfrac{q}{2}\\\\Bigr\\\\rceil.\\n    \\\\]\\n3.  Otherwise (root is `?`):\\n    -  Case 1 (Iris gets the first relevant move):  \\n       Iris picks the root, so she obtains\\n       \\\\(\\\\max(f_0,f_1)\\\\) from the fixed leaves; then Dora picks the first of the \\\\(q\\\\) leaves, so Iris will pick \\\\(\\\\lfloor q/2\\\\rfloor\\\\) of them.  \\n       Call\\n       \\\\[\\n         C_1 \\\\;=\\\\;\\\\max(f_0,f_1)\\\\;+\\\\;\\\\Bigl\\\\lfloor\\\\tfrac{q}{2}\\\\Bigr\\\\rfloor.\\n       \\\\]\\n    -  Case 2 (Dora gets the first relevant move):  \\n       Dora picks the root, contributing \\\\(\\\\min(f_0,f_1)\\\\); then Iris picks the first of the \\\\(q\\\\) leaves, so Iris will pick \\\\(\\\\lceil q/2\\\\rceil\\\\) of them.  \\n       Call\\n       \\\\[\\n         C_2 \\\\;=\\\\;\\\\min(f_0,f_1)\\\\;+\\\\;\\\\Bigl\\\\lceil\\\\tfrac{q}{2}\\\\Bigr\\\\rceil.\\n       \\\\]\\n    -  If there is at least one irrelevant `?` (\\\\(U>0\\\\)), Iris can choose whether relevant moves start with her or with Dora, so she will pick \\\\(\\\\max(C_1,C_2)\\\\).  \\n      If there are no irrelevant `?` (\\\\(U=0\\\\)), the relevant game _must_ start with Iris, so the answer is \\\\(C_1\\\\).\\n\\nThis runs in \\\\(O(n)\\\\) per test case (just counting degrees and the various classes of nodes) and thus is \\\\(O(N)\\\\) overall.\\n\\n---\\n\\n```java\\nimport java.io.*;\\nimport java.util.*;\\n\\npublic class Main {\\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\\n        BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));\\n        int t = Integer.parseInt(in.readLine().trim());\\n        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\\n        \\n        while (t-- > 0) {\\n            int n = Integer.parseInt(in.readLine().trim());\\n            int[] deg = new int[n+1];\\n            for (int i = 0; i < n-1; i++) {\\n                StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(in.readLine());\\n                int u = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\\n                int v = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\\n                deg[u]++; \\n                deg[v]++;\\n            }\\n            String s = in.readLine().trim();\\n            \\n            // Identify the leaves (degree 1, but not node 1),\\n            // and count f0/f1/q among those leaves:\\n            int f0 = 0, f1 = 0, ql = 0;\\n            for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {\\n                if (deg[i] == 1) {  // it's a leaf\\n                    char c = s.charAt(i-1);\\n                    if (c == '0') f0++;\\n                    else if (c == '1') f1++;\\n                    else            ql++;\\n                }\\n            }\\n            \\n            // Count total '?' in the whole tree:\\n            int totQ = 0;\\n            for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {\\n                if (c == '?') totQ++;\\n            }\\n            boolean rootQ = (s.charAt(0) == '?');\\n            // Number of irrelevant '?' = total '?' minus\\n            // (leaf '?' plus 1 if root is '?'):\\n            int irrelevant = totQ - ql - (rootQ ? 1 : 0);\\n            boolean hasIrrelevant = (irrelevant > 0);\\n            \\n            int answer;\\n            // Case A: root is already fixed\\n            if (!rootQ) {\\n                char r = s.charAt(0);\\n                int base = (r == '0' ? f1 : f0);\\n                // plus the ceiling of ql/2:\\n                int add = (ql + 1) / 2;\\n                answer = base + add;\\n            }\\n            else {\\n                // Root is '?'.
