All the pairwise products\n    \\[\n       a_i \\cdot a_{i+1},\\quad i=1,2,\\dots,n-1\n    \\]\n    are *distinct*.\n\n2.  Among all such sequences, we use the *minimum* number of distinct values (i.e., the size of \\(\\{a_1,\\dots,a_n\\}\\) is as small as possible).\n\n---\n\n**Key observations**\n\n1.  If we use only \\(k\\) distinct values, these values can be “labeled” \\(1,2,\\dots,k\\).  Then the possible products \\(a_i\\cdot a_{i+1}\\) are exactly the unordered pairs\n    \\[\n       \\{x,y\\},\\quad 1\\le x\\le y\\le k,\n    \\]\n    of which there are\n    \\[\n       \\binom{k+1}{2} \\;=\\;\\frac{k(k+1)}2\n    \\]\n    choices (each yields a distinct product as long as the labels \\(1,2,\\dots,k\\) are all distinct integers).\n\n2.  We need \\(n-1\\) *distinct* products.  Hence we need\n    \\[\n       \\frac{k(k+1)}2 \\;\\ge\\; n-1.\n    \\]\n    We also have a small wrinkle: if \\(k>2\\) is *even*, the graph of \\(k\\) vertices (with loops) has every vertex of odd degree, so it has more than 2 odd‐degree vertices and cannot support an Euler trail that uses each edge exactly once.  However:\n\n   - For \\(k=1\\), there is exactly one loop, degree \\(2\\), so all even, and we get one edge.\n   - For \\(k=2\\), each of the two vertices has degree \\(3\\) (two from its loop, one from the edge to the other vertex), so exactly two odd vertices → an Euler *trail* exists.\n   - For any *odd* \\(k\\ge3\\), each vertex has degree \\((k-1)+2 = k+1\\), which is even, so the whole graph is Eulerian.\n\n   Hence the *allowable* \\(k\\) (minimum distinct values) are\n\n   - \\(k=1\\) if \\(n-1\\le1\\) (i.e.\\ \\(n\\le2\\)),\n   - \\(k=2\\) if \\(2\\le n-1\\le3\\) (i.e.\\ \\(3\\le n\\le4\\)),\n   - otherwise the *smallest odd* \\(k\\ge3\\) with \\(\\tfrac{k(k+1)}2\\ge n-1\\).\n\n3.  Once we fix such a \\(k\\), we build the multigraph on vertices \\(\\{1,2,\\dots,k\\}\\) with:\n   - A *loop* at each vertex \\(i\\) (counts as one edge but two incidences),\n   - A single edge between each pair \\(i<j\\).\n\n   This graph has exactly \\(\\tfrac{k(k+1)}2\\) edges total.  An Eulerian circuit (or trail if \\(k=2\\)) in this graph is a walk that uses each edge exactly once, hence visits exactly \\(\\tfrac{k(k+1)}2+1\\) vertices in a row (possibly repeating the same vertex when traversing loops).  Reading off that walk as\n   \\[\n     v_0, v_1, v_2,\\dots,v_{\\tfrac{k(k+1)}2}\n   \\]\n   we get \\(\\tfrac{k(k+1)}2\\) consecutive products\n   \\(\\{\\,v_i,v_{i+1}\\}\\), all distinct.  We only need the *first* \\(n\\) terms of that walk, giving \\(n-1\\) distinct products.\n\n4.  We implement a standard **Hierholzer** algorithm to find an Euler tour (or trail) in \\(O(E)\\) time.  Since\n   \\[\n     E \\;=\\;\\frac{k(k+1)}2\\;\\lesssim\\;10^6\n   \\]\n   in the worst case \\((k\\approx1400)\\), and \\(\\sum n\\le10^6\\), this runs comfortably in time.\n\n---\n\n**Implementation (Java)**\n\n```java\nimport java.io.*;\nimport java.util.*;\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\n        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));\n        StringBuilder   sb = new StringBuilder();\n        int t = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine().trim());\n        while (t-- > 0) {\n            int n = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine().trim());\n            int m = n - 1;  // we need m distinct products\n            \n            // 1) Decide the minimal k\n            int k;\n            if (m <= 1) {\n                k = 1;\n            } else if (m <= 3) {\n                k = 2;\n            } else {\n                // find minimal k with k(k+1)/2 >= m\n                double D = 1.0 + 8.0 * m;\n                double root = Math.sqrt(D);\n                int kk = (int)((root - 1.0) / 2.0); // floor\n                while ((long)kk * (kk + 1) / 2 < m) {\n                    kk++;\n                }\n                // if kk > 2 and even, make it odd\n                if (kk > 2 && (kk % 2 == 0)) kk++;\n                k = kk;\n            }\n            \n            // 2) Build the adjacency structure of our multigraph\n            //    We number edges 0..E-1, where E = k(k+1)/2.\n            int E = k * (k + 1) / 2;\n            // We'll store 2*E incidences in a static adjacency array,\n            // since each edge contributes 2 endpoints (the loop\n            // contributes two incidences on the same vertex).\n            int[] head = new int[k+1];\n            int[] to   = new int[2*E];\n            int[] nxt  = new int[2*E];\n            int[] eid  = new int[2*E];\n            int[] deg  = new int[k+1];\n            Arrays.fill(head, -1);\n            \n            // helper to add an incidence\n            int ec = 0;  // index into the incidence arrays\n            class Loc { void add(int u, int v, int id) {\n                    to  [ec] = v;\n                    eid [ec] = id;\n                    nxt [ec] = head[u];\n                    head[u] = ec++;\n                    deg[u]++;\n                }\n            }\n            Loc L = new Loc();\n            \n            // enumerate edges (i<=j)\n            int id = 0;\n            for (int i = 1; i <= k; i++) {\n                for (int j = i; j <= k; j++) {\n                    if (i == j) {\n                        // loop -> two incidences on i\n                        L.add(i, j, id);\n                        L.add(i, j, id);\n                    } else {\n                        // single edge i--j\n                        L.add(i, j, id);\n                        L.add(j, i, id);\n                    }\n                    id++;\n                }\n            }\n            \n            // 3) Decide the start vertex for Hierholzer\n            List<Integer> oddV = new ArrayList<>();\n            for (int i = 1; i <= k; i++) {\n                if ((deg[i] & 1) == 1) {\n                    oddV.add(i);\n                }\n            }\n            int start = 1;\n            if (oddV.size() == 2) {\n                // for k=2, we have exactly 2 odd-degree vertices\n                start = oddV.get(0);\n            }\n            \n            // 4) Hierholzer's algorithm (iterative)\n            boolean[] usedEdge = new boolean[E];\n            int[] cur   = new int[k+1];\n            System.arraycopy(head, 0, cur, 0, k+1);\n            \n            int[] stack = new int[E+2];\n            int  sp = 0;\n            stack[sp++] = start;\n            \n            int[] circuit = new int[E+1];\n            int  cp = 0;\n            \n            while (sp > 0) {\n                int v = stack[sp-1];\n                // advance cur[v] to the next unused incidence\n                int c = cur[v];\n                while (c != -1 && usedEdge[eid[c]]) {\n                    c = nxt[c];\n                }\n                cur[v] = c;\n                if (c == -1) {\n                    // no more edges out of v\n                    sp--;\n                    circuit[cp++] = v;\n                } else {\n                    // traverse edge\n                    usedEdge[eid[c]] = true;\n                    cur[v] = nxt[c];\n                    stack[sp++] = to[c];\n                }\n            }\n            \n            // circuit[] is in *reverse* order, length = E+1\n            // we only need the first n vertices of the *reversed* circuit\n            // i.e. reversed( circuit ) gives the Euler walk\n            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                int ans = circuit[cp - 1 - i];\n                sb.append(ans).append(i+1<n?'

With \\(k\\) distinct values, the maximum number of distinct unordered products (including squares) is\n    \\[\n       \\binom{k+1}2 \\;=\\;\\frac{k(k+1)}2.\n    \\]\n    Hence \\(\\tfrac{k(k+1)}2\\ge n-1\\).  Further, except for the cases \\(k=1\\) or \\(k=2\\), if \\(k>2\\) is even, the graph becomes non‐Eulerian (it has more than two odd‐degree vertices).  Thus the optimal \\(k\\) is\n    \\[\n       k=1\\quad(\\text{if }n\\le 2),\\quad\n       k=2\\quad(\\text{if }3\\le n\\le4),\\quad\n       \\text{the smallest odd }k\\ge3\\text{ with }\\tfrac{k(k+1)}2\\ge n-1\n       \\quad(\\text{otherwise}).\n    \\]\n\n2.  **Building the Graph**  \n    We create a multigraph on vertices \\(\\{1,\\dots,k\\}\\), with\n    - one *loop* at each \\(i\\) (this contributes two incidences at \\(i\\)),  \n    - one edge between each pair \\(i<j\\).  \n    Totalling \\(\\tfrac{k(k+1)}2\\) edges.  \n\n3.  **Finding an Euler Tour/Trail**  \n    By parity checks, either all degrees are even (when \\(k\\) is odd) → there is an **Euler circuit**, or exactly two vertices are odd (when \\(k=2\\)) → there is an **Euler trail**.  \n    Using the standard *Hierholzer* algorithm in \\(O(E)\\) time, we produce a walk of length \\(E\\!+\\!1\\) that uses every edge exactly once.\n\n4.  **Extracting the Answer**  \n    That Euler walk is a sequence of vertices\n    \\[\n      v_0, v_1, v_2,\\dots,v_E,\n    \\]\n    giving \\(E\\) distinct adjacent‐pair products \\(\\{v_i,v_{i+1}\\}\\).  We need only the first \\(n\\) of these vertices, which gives \\(n-1\\) distinct products, and exactly \\(k\\) distinct values overall (the minimum possible).\n\nThis runs in \\(O(k^2)\\) per test, but \\(\\sum k^2\\approx\\sum n\\le10^6\\), which comfortably fits under the time limit. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/0zq3nDf.png)  (Illustration of constructing and walking the Euler graph – each edge is one distinct product.)"
