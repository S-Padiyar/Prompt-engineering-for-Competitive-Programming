You can perform the following operation exactly once:\n\n\n\nChoose an integer p\n\n (1≤p≤n\n\n).\n\nReverse the substring s1s2…sp\n\n. After this step, the string s1s2…sn\n\n will become spsp−1…s1sp+1sp+2…sn\n\n.\n\nThen, perform a cyclic shift of the string s\n\n to the left p\n\n times. After this step, the initial string s1s2…sn\n\n will become sp+1sp+2…snspsp−1…s1\n\n.\n\nFor example, if you apply the operation to the string 110001100110 with p=3\n\n, after the second step, the string will become 011001100110, and after the third step, it will become 001100110011.\n\n\n\nA string s\n\n is called k\n\n-proper if two conditions are met:\n\n\n\ns1=s2=…=sk\n\n;\n\nsi+k≠si\n\n for any i\n\n (1≤i≤n−k\n\n).\n\nFor example, with k=3\n\n, the strings 000, 111000111, and 111000 are k\n\n-proper, while the strings 000000, 001100, and 1110000 are not.\n\n\n\nYou are given an integer k\n\n, which is a divisor of n\n\n. Find an integer p\n\n (1≤p≤n\n\n) such that after performing the operation, the string s\n\n becomes k\n\n-proper, or determine that it is impossible. Note that if the string is initially k\n\n-proper, you still need to apply exactly one operation to it.\n\n\n\nInput\n\nEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains one integer t\n\n (1≤t≤104\n\n) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.\n\n\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers n\n\n and k\n\n (1≤k≤n\n\n, 2≤n≤105\n\n) — the length of the string s\n\n and the value of k\n\n. It is guaranteed that k\n\n is a divisor of n\n\n.\n\n\n\nThe second line of each test case contains a binary string s\n\n of length n\n\n, consisting of the characters 0 and 1.\n\n\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n\n\n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105\n\n.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single integer — the value of p\n\n to make the string k\n\n-proper, or −1\n\n if it is impossible.\n\n\n\nIf there are multiple solutions, output any of them.\n\n\n\nExample\n\nInputCopy\n\n7\n\n8 4\n\n11100001\n\n4 2\n\n1110\n\n12 3\n\n111000100011\n\n5 5\n\n00000\n\n6 1\n\n101001\n\n8 4\n\n01110001\n\n12 2\n\n110001100110\n\nOutputCopy\n\n3\n\n-1\n\n7\n\n5\n\n4\n\n-1\n\n3\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, if you apply the operation with p=3\n\n, after the second step of the operation, the string becomes 11100001, and after the third step, it becomes 00001111.

    "content": "**Analysis**\n\nWe have a binary string \\(s\\) of length \\(n\\) and an integer \\(k\\) (which divides \\(n\\)).  We want to choose exactly one integer \\(p\\) (\\(1 \\le p \\le n\\)) so that if we\n\n  1. Reverse the prefix \\(s_1 s_2 \\dots s_p\\).\n  2. Rotate the entire new string left by \\(p\\) positions,\n\nthe resulting string becomes *\\(k\\)-proper*.  Recall that a string \\(t\\) of length \\(n\\) is *\\(k\\)-proper* if\n\n  - All of the first \\(k\\) characters are the same: \\(t_1 = t_2 = \\dots = t_k\\).\n  - For every \\(i=1,2,\\dots,n-k\\), we have \\(t_{i+k}\\neq t_i\\).\n\nThat is equivalent to saying that \\(t\\) looks like\n\\[\n\\underbrace{xxx\\cdots x}_{k}\\,\\underbrace{yyy\\cdots y}_{k}\\,\\underbrace{xxx\\cdots x}_{k}\\,\\underbrace{yyy\\cdots y}_{k}\\,\\dots\n\\]\nwhere \\(x\\in\\{0,1\\}\\) and \\(y=1-x\\).  In particular, there are exactly two possible \\(k\\)-proper strings of length \\(n\\): one starting with \\(0\\) in the first block of \\(k\\), the other with \\(1\\).\n\nLet us write down those two target strings of length \\(n\\):\n\n  - \\(T^{(0)}\\): first \\(k\\) zeros, next \\(k\\) ones, next \\(k\\) zeros, …\n  - \\(T^{(1)}\\): first \\(k\\) ones, next \\(k\\) zeros, next \\(k\\) ones, …\n\nWe need to see if there is some \\(p\\) so that applying the operation to \\(s\\) turns it exactly into \\(T^{(0)}\\) or \\(T^{(1)}\\).\n\n---\n\n## Characterizing the single operation\n\nLet us index everything \\(0\\)-based for convenience.  Our original string is\n\\[\ns = s[0],\\,s[1],\\dots,s[n-1].\n\\]\nWe pick a \\(p\\) with \\(1\\le p\\le n\\).  We\n\n1. Reverse the prefix \\(s[0..p-1]\\) to get\n   \\[\n     \\bigl(s[p-1],s[p-2],\\dots,s[0]\\bigr)\\quad\\text{followed by}\\quad s[p],s[p+1],\\dots,s[n-1].\n   \\]\n2. Then rotate the whole thing left by \\(p\\).  That has the effect\n   of sending positions \\(0..p-1\\) to the end (in the same order they appear after the reversal)  \n   and sliding the suffix \\(p..n-1\\) to the front.\n\nThus the final string \\(b\\) after the two steps is\n\\[\nb = \n\\underbrace{s[p],\\,s[p+1],\\,\\dots,\\,s[n-1]}_{\\text{length }n-p}\n\\;\\;+\\;\n\\underbrace{s[p-1],\\,s[p-2],\\dots,s[0]}_{\\text{length }p}.\n\\]\nWe want \\(b = T^{(x)}\\) for \\(x\\in\\{0,1\\}\\).\n\nEquivalently, one may “invert” this operation on \\(T^{(x)}\\) and see whether it becomes \\(s\\).  Indeed if\n\\[\nb = T^{(x)},\n\\]\nthen the original \\(s\\) after inverting the same \\((p\\)-operation) is\n\\[\ns = \\bigl(T^{(x)}[n-p..n-1]\\bigr)_{\\text{reversed}}\\;+\\;T^{(x)}[0..n-p-1].\n\\]\nWe then only need to test, for each \\(x=0\\) or \\(1\\), and each \\(1\\le p\\le n\\), whether that string equals the given \\(s\\).  Doing that by naively building strings for every \\(p\\) would be \\(O(n^2)\\), too big for \\(n\\) up to \\(10^5\\).\n\nInstead we note:\n\n  - If we call\n    \\[\n      A = \\text{reverse}(T^{(x)}[\\,n-p..n-1\\,]),\n      \\quad\n      B = T^{(x)}[\\,0..n-p-1\\,],\n    \\]\n    we need\n    \\[\n      s\\,\\equiv\\,A \\;+\\; B.\n    \\]\n    In other words,\n    \\[\n      s[0..p-1] = A[0..p-1],\\quad\n      s[p..n-1] = B[0..n-p-1].\n    \\]\n  - But\n    \\[\n      A[0..p-1]\n      =\n      \\bigl(T^{(x)}[n-1],T^{(x)}[n-2],\\dots,T^{(x)}[n-p]\\bigr),\n    \\]\n    which is precisely the first \\(p\\) characters of \\(\\mathrm{rev}(T^{(x)})\\).  \n    And \\(B[0..n-p-1]\\) is just the prefix of \\(T^{(x)}\\) of length \\(n-p\\).\n\nThus to test all \\(p\\) at once it suffices to know:\n\n  1.  The longest common prefix between \\(s\\) and \\(\\mathrm{rev}(T^{(x)})\\).  Call its length \\(\\ell\\).  Then for every \\(p \\le \\ell\\), we have\n       \\[\n         s[0..p-1] = \\mathrm{rev}(T^{(x)})[0..p-1].\n       \\]\n  2.  For the second condition we must have\n       \\[\n         s[p..n-1] = T^{(x)}[0..n-p-1].\n       \\]\n       This is exactly the statement that the substring \\(s[p..]\\) matches the prefix of \\(T^{(x)}\\) of length \\(n-p\\).  \n       We can answer all those “suffix vs.\\ prefix” queries in linear total time using the standard Z-algorithm on the string\n       \\[\n         V = T^{(x)} \\;+\\; “\\#” \\;+\\; s.\n       \\]\n       If \\(Z[i]\\) is the usual Z-array of \\(V\\), then for a given \\(p\\) (in \\(1\\le p<n\\)), we look at\n       \\[\n         i = n+1 + p\n         \\quad\n         (\\text{i.e.\\ the position in \\(V\\) where }s[p]\\text{ starts})\n       \\]\n       and check whether\n       \\[\n         Z[i] \\;\\ge\\; n - p.\n       \\]\n       (If \\(p=n\\) we only need to match an empty suffix so that is trivially true.)\n\nHence the algorithm per test case \\(s,n,k\\) is:\n\n  1. Build the two target patterns \\(T^{(0)}\\) and \\(T^{(1)}\\) of length \\(n\\), alternating blocks of size \\(k\\).\n  2. For each \\(x\\in\\{0,1\\}\\):\n     a. Compute \\(\\ell = \\) LCP\\bigl(\\(s\\), rev\\((T^{(x)})\\)\\bigr) by a simple loop in \\(O(n)\\).  \n     b. Form \\(V = T^{(x)} + \\# + s\\) and compute the Z-array in \\(O(n)\\).  \n     c. Check any \\(p=1,2,\\dots,n\\) with \\(p\\le \\ell\\) and (either \\(p=n\\) or \\(Z[n+1+p]\\ge n-p\\)).  If one works, output it and stop.\n  3. If neither \\(x\\) gave a solution, print \\(-1\\).\n\nThe total work per test is \\(O(n)\\), and the sum of all \\(n\\) over all tests is \\(\\le 2\\cdot 10^5\\), so this easily runs in under 2 s.\n\n---\n\n```java\nimport java.io.*;\nimport java.util.*;\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\n        BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));\n        PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(System.out);\n\n        int t = Integer.parseInt(in.readLine().trim());\n        while (t-- > 0) {\n            String[] nk = in.readLine().split(\" \");\n            int n = Integer.parseInt(nk[0]);\n            int k = Integer.parseInt(nk[1]);\n            String s = in.readLine().trim();\n\n            // Build the two candidate k-proper patterns T0 and T1\n            // T0 starts with 0, T1 starts with 1\n            char[] T0 = new char[n], T1 = new char[n];\n            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                int block = (i / k) % 2;  // 0 for \"first block\", 1 for \"second block\", ...\n                T0[i] = (block == 0 ?

Then *any* \\(p \\le \\ell\\) automatically satisfies the first condition.\n   - To check the second condition for *all* \\(p\\) simultaneously, we form the concatenation\n     \\[\n       V = T \\;+\\; “\\#” \\;+\\; s\n     \\]\n     and compute the standard Z-array on \\(V\\).  Then for \\(1\\le p<n\\), the substring \\(s[p..]\\) starts in \\(V\\) at index \\(n+1+p\\), and\n     \\[\n       Z[n+1+p] \\;\\ge\\; n - p\n     \\]\n     exactly means \\(s[p..n-1]\\) matches \\(T[0..n-p-1]\\).\n\nThis runs in \\(O(n)\\) per test and easily handles \\(\\sum n\\le 2\\times 10^5\\)."
