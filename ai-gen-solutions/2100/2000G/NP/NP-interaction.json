Call During the Journey\n\ntime limit per test4 seconds\n\nmemory limit per test256 megabytes\n\nYou live in a city consisting of n\n\n intersections and m\n\n streets connecting some pairs of intersections. You can travel in either direction on each street. No two streets connect the same pair of intersections, and no street connects an intersection to itself. You can reach any intersection from any other, possibly passing through some other intersections.\n\n\n\nEvery minute, you can board a bus at intersection ui\n\n and travel for li1\n\n minutes to intersection vi\n\n. Conversely, you can travel from intersection vi\n\n to intersection ui\n\n in li1\n\n minutes. You can only board and exit the bus at intersections. You can only board the bus at an intersection if you are currently there.\n\n\n\nYou can also walk along each street, which takes li2>li1\n\n minutes.\n\n\n\nYou can make stops at intersections.\n\n\n\nYou live at intersection number 1\n\n. Today you woke up at time 0\n\n, and you have an important event scheduled at intersection number n\n\n, which you must reach no later than time t0\n\n. You also have a phone call planned that will last from t1\n\n to t2\n\n minutes (t1<t2<t0\n\n).\n\n\n\nDuring the phone call, you cannot ride the bus, but you can walk along any streets, make stops, or stay at home. You can exit the bus at minute t1\n\n and board the bus again at minute t2\n\n.\n\n\n\nSince you want to get enough sleep, you became curious — how late can you leave home to have time to talk on the phone and still not be late for the event?\n\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t\n\n (1≤t≤104\n\n) — the number of test cases. The following are the descriptions of the test cases.\n\n\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers n\n\n, m\n\n (2≤n≤105,1≤m≤105\n\n) — the number of intersections and streets in the city.\n\n\n\nThe second line of each test case contains three integers t0\n\n, t1\n\n, t2\n\n (1≤t1<t2<t0≤109\n\n) — the start time of the event, the start time of the phone call, and its end time, respectively.\n\n\n\nThe next m\n\n lines of each test case contain descriptions of the streets.\n\n\n\nThe i\n\n-th line contains four integers ui\n\n, vi\n\n, li1\n\n, li2\n\n (1≤ui,vi≤n\n\n, ui≠vi\n\n, 1≤li1<li2≤109\n\n) — the numbers of the intersections connected by the i\n\n-th street, as well as the travel time along the street by bus and on foot. It is guaranteed that no two streets connect the same pair of intersections and that it is possible to reach any intersection from any other.\n\n\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n\n\n across all test cases does not exceed 105\n\n. It is also guaranteed that the sum of the values of m\n\n across all test cases does not exceed 105\n\n.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single integer — the latest time you can leave home to have time to talk on the phone and not be late for the event. If you cannot reach the event on time, output -1.\n\n\n\nExample\n\nInputCopy\n\n7\n\n5 5\n\n100 20 80\n\n1 5 30 100\n\n1 2 20 50\n\n2 3 20 50\n\n3 4 20 50\n\n4 5 20 50\n\n2 1\n\n100 50 60\n\n1 2 55 110\n\n4 4\n\n100 40 60\n\n1 2 30 100\n\n2 4 30 100\n\n1 3 20 50\n\n3 4 20 50\n\n3 3\n\n100 80 90\n\n1 2 1 10\n\n2 3 10 50\n\n1 3 20 21\n\n3 2\n\n58 55 57\n\n2 1 1 3\n\n2 3 3 4\n\n2 1\n\n12 9 10\n\n2 1 6 10\n\n5 5\n\n8 5 6\n\n2 1 1 8\n\n2 3 4 8\n\n4 2 2 4\n\n5 3 3 4\n\n4 5 2 6\n\nOutputCopy\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n60\n\n80\n\n53\n\n3\n\n2\n\n---\n\nUse Java."

Thus the feasibility in \\\\(S\\\\) is a 0–1 predicate that goes\\n   \\\\[\\n     \\\\underbrace{0,1,\\\\,\\\\dots,\\\\,1}_{\\\\text{all }S\\\\le S^*}\\n     \\\\;\\\\;\\\\;0,0,\\\\dots\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\n     \\\\text{(infeasible for }S>S^*\\\\!).\\n   \\\\]\\n   We binary‐search for the largest feasible \\\\(S\\\\).\\n\\n2. **Time‐dependent Dijkstra check.**  \\n   - We keep a usual `dist[u]` = earliest time we can arrive at \\\\(u\\\\).  \\n   - Walking (edge‐cost \\\\(\\\\ell_2\\\\)) is _always_ allowed.  \\n   - Bus (cost \\\\(\\\\ell_1\\\\)) is allowed only if it does _not_ overlap the forbidden interval \\\\([t_1,t_2]\\\\).  Concretely:\\n     - If we board at time \\\\(\\\\tau< t_1\\\\), we must finish by \\\\(\\\\le t_1\\\\).  \\n     - Or if we board at \\\\(\\\\tau\\\\ge t_2\\\\), there is no overlap.  \\n\\n   We run a standard Dijkstra expansion (with a custom binary‐heap to be fast), stopping as soon as we either settle node \\\\(n\\\\) in time \\\\(\\\\le t_0\\\\) (success) or exhaust the queue / exceed \\\\(t_0\\\\) (failure).\\n\\n3. **Complexity.**  \\n   - Each Dijkstra is \\\\(O(m\\\\log n)\\\\).  \\n   - We do \\\\(O(\\\\log(t_0))\\\\approx 30\\\\) such runs per test case.  \\n   - Sum of \\\\(m\\\\) over all tests is \\\\(\\\\le10^5\\\\).  \\n   - So the total is about \\\\(30\\\\times10^5\\\\times\\\\log(10^5)\\\\approx 10^8\\\\) heap operations, which runs in time under the 4 s limit if implemented carefully in Java.\",\n        \"refusal\": null,\n        \"role\": \"assistant\",\n        \"annotations\": [],\n        \"audio\": null,\n        \"function_call\": null,\n        \"tool_calls\": null\n      },\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"protected_material_code\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": true,\n          \"citation\": {\n            \"URL\": \"https://github.com/ayoub62/letscode3/tree/2a026d6a39f1bf21c16913e1b11507bd9a1fee38/Space.java\",\n            \"license\": \"NOASSERTION\"\n          }\n        },\n        \"protected_material_text\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"created\": 1753309959,\n  \"model\": \"o4-mini-2025-04-16\",\n  \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n  \"service_tier\": null,\n  \"system_fingerprint\": null,\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"completion_tokens\": 14999,\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 959,\n    \"total_tokens\": 15958,\n    \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n      \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"reasoning_tokens\": 12160,\n      \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n    },\n    \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"cached_tokens\": 0\n    }\n  },\n  \"prompt_filter_results\": [\n    {\n      \"prompt_index\": 0,\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"jailbreak\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
