First, carefully read and restate the problem in your own words to ensure full understanding. Identify the input and output formats, list the constraints, and consider any edge cases that might affect the logic. Next, determine which algorithmic pattern the problem fits best—such as greedy, binary search, two pointers, dynamic programming, or graph traversal—and briefly explain why that pattern applies. Then, plan your solution step by step, describing the key ideas, data structures, or mathematical insights you’ll use. Once your plan is clear, write a clean and fully working Java program. Use import java.util.*; and include a Main class with a main method, using Scanner or BufferedReader for input depending on the constraints. Add comments to explain important logic in the code. After coding, walk through a sample input manually to show how your solution works in practice. Finally, analyze the time and space complexity of your approach using Big-O notation, justifying your answer. Think step by step and only write code once the logic is sound and complete."

Each city \\\\(i\\\\) has exactly two portals, each portal is one of four colors \\\\(\\\\{B,G,R,Y\\\\}\\\\), and the two portals in the same city are guaranteed to be of different colors. You may teleport between any two cities \\\\(i\\\\) and \\\\(j\\\\) **only** if they share **at least one** portal color, and the cost of teleporting directly is \\\\(\\\\lvert i - j\\\\rvert\\\\).\\n\\nWe are given \\\\(q\\\\) queries \\\\((x,y)\\\\); for each query we must find the minimum cost to get from city \\\\(x\\\\) to city \\\\(y\\\\) by possibly using several teleports, or report \\\\(-1\\\\) if it is impossible.\\n\\nConstraints summary:\\n\\n- \\\\(1 \\\\le t \\\\le 10^4\\\\) total test cases.\\n- Over all test cases, \\\\(\\\\sum n \\\\le 2\\\\cdot10^5\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\sum q \\\\le 2\\\\cdot10^5\\\\).\\n- Each city’s portals are one of the six distinct unordered color‐pairs: BG, BR, BY, GR, GY, or RY.\\n- Each query gives \\\\(1\\\\le x,y\\\\le n\\\\).\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Solution Outline**\\n\\n1. **Key Observation:**\\n   - If cities \\\\(x\\\\) and \\\\(y\\\\) share a color, you can teleport directly for cost \\\\(\\\\lvert x - y\\\\rvert\\\\).  \\n   - Otherwise, any shortest path from \\\\(x\\\\) to \\\\(y\\\\) uses exactly one *intermediate* city \\\\(p\\\\).  Why?  Because each city has exactly two different colors.  To “switch” from one color (from \\\\(x\\\\)) to another color (to reach \\\\(y\\\\)), you need at most one city that has exactly that pair of colors.  A longer chain of intermediate cities can always be shortcut to a single intermediate city without increasing cost, thanks to the metric \\\\(\\\\lvert i-j\\\\rvert\\\\).\\n\\n2. **Intermediate City Criterion:**\\n   - If \\\\(x\\\\) has colors \\\\(\\\\{c_1,c_2\\\\}\\\\) and \\\\(y\\\\) has colors \\\\(\\\\{d_1,d_2\\\\}\\\\), then a useful intermediate city must have one color in common with \\\\(x\\\\) (say \\\\(c_i\\\\)) and one color in common with \\\\(y\\\\) (say \\\\(d_j\\\\)), \\\\(c_i\\\\neq d_j\\\\).  \\n   - That intermediate city \\\\(p\\\\) is exactly one that has the unordered pair of colors \\\\(\\\\{c_i,d_j\\\\}\\\\).  \\n   - The total cost via \\\\(p\\\\) is \\\\(\\\\lvert x-p\\\\rvert+\\\\lvert p-y\\\\rvert\\\\).\\n\\n3. **Preprocessing:**\\n   - There are only six unordered color‐pairs: BG, BR, BY, GR, GY, RY.  \\n   - For each of these six pairs we build (and sort) a list of all city‐indices which have exactly that pair of colors.  \\n\\n4. **Answering a Query \\\\((x,y)\\\\):**\\n   - If \\\\(x=y\\\\), answer \\\\(0\\\\).  \\n   - If cities \\\\(x\\\\) and \\\\(y\\\\) share a color, answer \\\\(\\\\lvert x-y\\\\rvert\\\\).  \\n   - Otherwise, let \\\\(\\\\ell=\\\\min(x,y)\\\\) and \\\\(r=\\\\max(x,y)\\\\).  For each choice of \\\\(c\\\\in\\\\{\\\\text{colors of }x\\\\}\\\\) and \\\\(d\\\\in\\\\{\\\\text{colors of }y\\\\}\\\\) with \\\\(c\\\\neq d\\\\):\\n     - Look up the list `positions[c,d]` (the sorted city indices having the pair \\\\(\\\\{c,d\\\\}\\\\)).  \\n     - Binary‐search to find the insertion point of \\\\(\\\\ell\\\\).  \\n     - Check if there is an index in the range \\\\([\\\\ell,r]\\\\) — if yes, cost \\\\(=r-\\\\ell\\\\).  \\n     - Otherwise compare the closest city to the left of \\\\(\\\\ell\\\\) and the closest to the right of \\\\(r\\\\), computing  \\n        \\\\[\\n          \\\\min\\\\bigl[(\\\\ell - p_{\\\\text{left}}) + (r - p_{\\\\text{left}})\\\\,,\\\\;\\n                  (p_{\\\\text{right}}-\\\\ell) + (p_{\\\\text{right}} - r)\\\\bigr].\\n        \\\\]\\n   - Take the overall minimum.

We map each of the four colors to integers 0–3 to work with arrays easily.\\n2. We identify the six possible unordered pairs of distinct colors, and we give each such pair a small index \\\\(0\\\\ldots5\\\\).\\n3. As we read each city’s portal‐pair, we record its index (1‐based) into the corresponding list for that color‐pair.\\n4. For a query \\\\((x,y)\\\\):\\n   - If \\\\(x=y\\\\), cost is \\\\(0\\\\).\\n   - If they share a color, cost is \\\\(\\\\lvert x-y\\\\rvert\\\\).\\n   - Otherwise, any optimal route must go \\\\(x\\\\to p \\\\to y\\\\) for some city \\\\(p\\\\) that shares one portal color with \\\\(x\\\\) and the other with \\\\(y\\\\).  We check all 4 combinations of “one color of \\\\(x\\\\), one of \\\\(y\\\\)”.  \\n     - We retrieve the sorted list of cities having exactly that unordered pair of colors.\\n     - Binary‐search for the insertion point of \\\\(\\\\min(x,y)\\\\).  \\n     - If a city lies in the interval \\\\([\\\\min(x,y),\\\\max(x,y)]\\\\), it yields cost \\\\(\\\\max(x,y)-\\\\min(x,y)\\\\).  \\n     - Otherwise, compare the closest city just left of \\\\(\\\\min(x,y)\\\\) and just right of \\\\(\\\\max(x,y)\\\\), computing the two‐step cost \\\\(|x-p|+|y-p|\\\\).  \\n   - Take the minimum over all four possible color‐pair lists.\\n5.
