Beauty of the mountains\n\ntime limit per test2 seconds\n\nmemory limit per test256 megabytes\n\nNikita loves mountains and has finally decided to visit the Berlyand mountain range! The range was so beautiful that Nikita decided to capture it on a map. The map is a table of n\n\n rows and m\n\n columns, with each cell containing a non-negative integer representing the height of the mountain.\n\n\n\nHe also noticed that mountains come in two types:\n\n\n\nWith snowy caps.\n\nWithout snowy caps.\n\nNikita is a very pragmatic person. He wants the sum of the heights of the mountains with snowy caps to be equal to the sum of the heights of the mountains without them. He has arranged with the mayor of Berlyand, Polikarp Polikarpovich, to allow him to transform the landscape.\n\n\n\nNikita can perform transformations on submatrices of size k×k\n\n as follows: he can add an integer constant c\n\n to the heights of the mountains within this area, but the type of the mountain remains unchanged. Nikita can choose the constant c\n\n independently for each transformation. Note that c\n\n can be negative.\n\n\n\nBefore making the transformations, Nikita asks you to find out if it is possible to achieve equality of the sums, or if it is impossible. It doesn't matter at what cost, even if the mountains turn into canyons and have negative heights.\n\n\n\nIf only one type of mountain is represented on the map, then the sum of the heights of the other type of mountain is considered to be zero.\n\n\n\nInput\n\nEach test consists of several test cases. The first line contains an integer t\n\n (1≤t≤104\n\n) — the number of test cases. This is followed by a description of test cases.\n\n\n\nThe first line of each test case contains three integers n,m,k\n\n (1≤n,m≤500,1≤k≤min(n,m)\n\n).\n\n\n\nThe next n\n\n lines of each test case contain m\n\n integers aij\n\n (0≤aij≤109\n\n) — the initial heights of the mountains.\n\n\n\nThe next n\n\n binary strings of length m\n\n for each test case determine the type of mountain, '0\n\n' — with snowy caps, '1\n\n' — without them.\n\n\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n⋅m\n\n for all test cases does not exceed 250000\n\n.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output \"YES\" without quotes if it is possible to equalize the sums of the mountain heights, otherwise output \"NO\" without quotes. You can output each letter in any case (for example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\", and \"YES\" will be recognized as a positive answer).\n\n\n\nExample\n\nInputCopy\n\n8\n\n3 3 2\n\n7 11 3\n\n4 2 3\n\n0 1 15\n\n100\n\n010\n\n000\n\n4 4 3\n\n123 413 24 233\n\n123 42 0 216\n\n22 1 1 53\n\n427 763 22 6\n\n0101\n\n1111\n\n1010\n\n0101\n\n3 3 2\n\n2 1 1\n\n1 1 2\n\n1 5 4\n\n010\n\n101\n\n010\n\n3 3 2\n\n2 1 1\n\n1 1 2\n\n1 5 3\n\n010\n\n101\n\n010\n\n3 4 3\n\n46 49 50 1\n\n19 30 23 12\n\n30 25 1 46\n\n1000\n\n0100\n\n0010\n\n5 4 4\n\n39 30 0 17\n\n22 42 30 13\n\n10 44 46 35\n\n12 19 9 39\n\n21 0 45 40\n\n1000\n\n1111\n\n0011\n\n0111\n\n1100\n\n2 2 2\n\n3 4\n\n6 7\n\n00\n\n00\n\n2 2 2\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n01\n\n00\n\nOutputCopy\n\nYES\n\nNO\n\nYES\n\nNO\n\nYES\n\nNO\n\nYES\n\nYES\n\nNote\n\nThe mountain array from the first test case looks like this:\n\n\n\n\n\nInitially, the sum of the heights of the mountains with snowy caps is 11+3+4+3+0+1+15=37\n\n, and without them is 7+2=9\n\n.\n\n\n\nTo equalize these sums, we can perform two transformations:\n\n\n\nFirst transformation:\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the constant c\n\n can be negative.\n\n\n\nAfter the first transformation, the mountain array looks like this:\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond transformation:\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a result, the mountain array looks like this:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sum of the heights of the mountains with snowy caps is 17+9+9−16−20−19+15=−5\n\n, and without them is 7−12=−5\n\n, thus the answer is YES.\n\n---\n\nYou are a competitive programming assistant solving Codeforces problems using Java. First, carefully read and restate the problem in your own words to ensure full understanding. Identify the input and output formats, list the constraints, and consider any edge cases that might affect the logic. Next, determine which algorithmic pattern the problem fits best—such as greedy, binary search, two pointers, dynamic programming, or graph traversal—and briefly explain why that pattern applies. Then, plan your solution step by step, describing the key ideas, data structures, or mathematical insights you’ll use. Once your plan is clear, write a clean and fully working Java program. Use import java.util.*; and include a Main class with a main method, using Scanner or BufferedReader for input depending on the constraints. Add comments to explain important logic in the code. After coding, walk through a sample input manually to show how your solution works in practice. Finally, analyze the time and space complexity of your approach using Big-O notation, justifying your answer. Think step by step and only write code once the logic is sound and complete."
