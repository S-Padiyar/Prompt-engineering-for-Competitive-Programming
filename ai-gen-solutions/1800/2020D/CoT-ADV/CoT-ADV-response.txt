The problem asks us to maintain an initially empty undirected graph on n labeled vertices (points 1 through n), then process m “clique‐on‐AP” operations, each of which picks three integers (a, d, k), considers the arithmetic progression

  a, a+d, a+2d, …, a+k·d

and fully connects (i.e., makes a clique among) these k+1 points.  Finally, we must print the number of connected components in the resulting graph.

Naively, one could union‐find over the n points, and for each operation perform all k unions of consecutive AP‐neighbors (that already suffices to link the whole clique by transitivity).  But since k can be as large as O(n)=2⋅10^5 and there may be O(2⋅10^5) operations, doing ∑ k unions explicitly could be quadratic in n in the worst case.

We exploit two facts:

1. The number of distinct d’s is at most 10 (d∈[1…10]).  
2. Across all operations with the same d, each potential edge (x, x+d) between a vertex x and x+d can only ever need to be added once.  Once we add it, every future “clique‐on‐AP” operation with the same d will find it already present and skip it.

We implement one Disjoint‐Set-Union (DSU) over vertices [1…n] to maintain connectivity, plus a “next‐pointer” trick for each d∈[1…10]:

— We allocate an array next[d][1…n+1], initialized so next[d][i]=i for all i.  
— To “remove” (mark processed) the edge‐start i (meaning we unite i and i+d), we do

  next[d][i] = FindNext(d, i+d)

so that future searches for the “next unprocessed start ≥ i” will jump to i+d (or beyond, if that too has been processed).

— FindNext(d,x) walks up next[d] pointers (with path compression) to return the smallest y ≥ x for which next[d][y]=y (i.e. y is still unprocessed).

When we handle an operation (a,d,k), its APSegment is a + j·d for j=0…k.  The edges we need are precisely the (k) edges  
(a, a+d), (a+d, a+2d), …, (a+(k−1)d, a+k·d).  
We loop:

  x = FindNext(d,a);  
  while(x + d ≤ a + k·d) {  
     DSU.union(x, x+d);             // merge these two points
     next[d][x] = FindNext(d, x+d); // mark edge(x,x+d) done
     x = next[d][x];                // jump to next start ≥ x
  }

Each edge‐start i (i.e. potential edge (i, i+d)) is ever removed at most once, so overall we do O(n·10) = O(n) DSU‐unions and pointer‐hops across all operations.  Since ∑n, ∑m ≤2·10^5, this runs in softly linear time.

Explanation of the main ideas:

1. We only ever need to link each potential edge \((i,i+d)\) once.  
2. For fixed \(d\in[1..10]\), we keep an array `nextEdge[d]` of size \(\le n+1\).  Initially `nextEdge[d][i]=i`.  
3. Whenever we process and add the edge \((i,i+d)\), we “remove” index \(i\) by setting  
       nextEdge[d][i] = FindNext(d, i+d),  
   so that future searches for “the next unprocessed start ≥ i” skip over it in \(O(\alpha(n))\) amortized time.  
4. Summed across all operations, there are at most \(\sum_{d=1}^{10}(n-d)=O(n)\) such distinct edges, so we do only \(O(n)\) DSU unions in total.  
5. Remaining DSU operations (finds, path compressions) also stay in \(O(n\alpha(n))\).  

Thus the overall complexity is \(O((n+m)\,\alpha(n))\) per test, comfortably within the \(n,m\le2\cdot10^5\) limits.
