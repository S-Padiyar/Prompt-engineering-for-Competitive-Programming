Reverse the Rivers\n\ntime limit per test2 seconds\n\nmemory limit per test256 megabytes\n\nA conspiracy of ancient sages, who decided to redirect rivers for their own convenience, has put the world on the brink. But before implementing their grand plan, they decided to carefully think through their strategy — that's what sages do.\n\n\n\nThere are n\n\n countries, each with exactly k\n\n regions. For the j\n\n-th region of the i\n\n-th country, they calculated the value ai,j\n\n, which reflects the amount of water in it.\n\n\n\nThe sages intend to create channels between the j\n\n-th region of the i\n\n-th country and the j\n\n-th region of the (i+1)\n\n-th country for all 1≤i≤(n−1)\n\n and for all 1≤j≤k\n\n.\n\n\n\nSince all n\n\n countries are on a large slope, water flows towards the country with the highest number. According to the sages' predictions, after the channel system is created, the new value of the j\n\n-th region of the i\n\n-th country will be bi,j=a1,j|a2,j|...|ai,j\n\n, where |\n\n denotes the bitwise \"OR\" operation.\n\n\n\nAfter the redistribution of water, the sages aim to choose the most suitable country for living, so they will send you q\n\n queries for consideration.\n\n\n\nEach query will contain m\n\n requirements.\n\n\n\nEach requirement contains three parameters: the region number r\n\n, the sign o\n\n (either \"<\n\n\" or \">\n\n\"), and the value c\n\n. If o\n\n = \"<\n\n\", then in the r\n\n-th region of the country you choose, the new value must be strictly less than the limit c\n\n, and if o\n\n = \">\n\n\", it must be strictly greater.\n\n\n\nIn other words, the chosen country i\n\n must satisfy all m\n\n requirements. If in the current requirement o\n\n = \"<\n\n\", then it must hold that bi,r<c\n\n, and if o\n\n = \">\n\n\", then bi,r>c\n\n.\n\n\n\nIn response to each query, you should output a single integer — the number of the suitable country. If there are multiple such countries, output the smallest one. If no such country exists, output −1\n\n.\n\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains three integers n\n\n, k\n\n, and q\n\n (1≤n,k,q≤105\n\n) — the number of countries, regions, and queries, respectively.\n\n\n\nNext, there are n\n\n lines, where the i\n\n-th line contains k\n\n integers ai,1,ai,2,…,ai,k\n\n (1≤ai,j≤109\n\n), where ai,j\n\n is the value of the j\n\n-th region of the i\n\n-th country.\n\n\n\nThen, q\n\n queries are described.\n\n\n\nThe first line of each query contains a single integer m\n\n (1≤m≤105\n\n) — the number of requirements.\n\n\n\nThen follow m\n\n lines, each containing an integer r\n\n, a character o\n\n, and an integer c\n\n (1≤r≤k\n\n, 0≤c≤2⋅109\n\n), where r\n\n and c\n\n are the region number and the value, and o\n\n is either \"<\n\n\" or \">\n\n\" — the sign.\n\n\n\nIt is guaranteed that n⋅k\n\n does not exceed 105\n\n and that the sum of m\n\n across all queries also does not exceed 105\n\n.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each query, output a single integer on a new line — the smallest number of the suitable country, or −1\n\n if no such country exists.\n\n\n\nExample\n\nInputCopy\n\n3 4 4\n\n1 3 5 9\n\n4 6 5 3\n\n2 1 2 7\n\n3\n\n1 > 4\n\n2 < 8\n\n1 < 6\n\n2\n\n1 < 8\n\n2 > 8\n\n1\n\n3 > 5\n\n2\n\n4 > 8\n\n1 < 8\n\nOutputCopy\n\n2\n\n-1\n\n3\n\n1\n\nNote\n\nIn the example, the initial values of the regions are as follows:\n\n\n\n1\n\n3\n\n5\n\n9\n\n4\n\n6\n\n5\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n2\n\n7\n\nAfter creating the channels, the new values will look like this:\n\n\n\n1\n\n3\n\n5\n\n9\n\n1|4\n\n3|6\n\n5|5\n\n9|3\n\n1|4|2\n\n3|6|1\n\n5|5|2\n\n9|3|7\n\n↓\n\n1\n\n3\n\n5\n\n9\n\n5\n\n7\n\n5\n\n11\n\n7\n\n7\n\n7\n\n15\n\nIn the first query, it is necessary to output the minimum country number (i.e., row) where, after the redistribution of water in the first region (i.e., column), the new value will be greater than four and less than six, and in the second region it will be less than eight. Only the country with number 2\n\n meets these requirements.\n\n\n\nIn the second query, there are no countries that meet the specified requirements.\n\n\n\nIn the third query, only the country with number 3\n\n is suitable.\n\n\n\nIn the fourth query, all three countries meet the conditions, so the answer is the smallest number 1\n\n.\n\n---\n\nLet's think step-by-step so we don't make mistakes.

Concretely:\\n\\n- If the requirement is “\\\\(b_{i,r} < c\\\\),” then since the sequence \\\\(b_{1,r},b_{2,r},\\\\dots\\\\) is nondecreasing, the set of indices \\\\(i\\\\) satisfying \\\\(b_{i,r}<c\\\\) is a prefix\\n  \\\\[\\n    i\\\\in [1,\\\\;f-1],\\n    \\\\quad\\\\text{where }f=\\\\min\\\\{i\\\\mid b_{i,r}\\\\ge c\\\\}.\\n  \\\\]\\n  In code we find \\\\(f\\\\) via a lower‐bound search, then the valid interval is \\\\([1,f-1]\\\\).\\n\\n- If the requirement is “\\\\(b_{i,r} > c\\\\),” then the set of \\\\(i\\\\) is a suffix\\n  \\\\[\\n    i\\\\in [f,n],\\n    \\\\quad\\\\text{where }f=\\\\min\\\\{i\\\\mid b_{i,r}>c\\\\}.\\n  \\\\]\\n  We find that \\\\(f\\\\) by an upper‐bound search, and the valid interval is \\\\([f,n]\\\\).\\n\\nA query with \\\\(m\\\\) requirements yields \\\\(m\\\\) intervals on the row‐index axis; the rows satisfying *all* requirements lie in the intersection of these intervals.  We just keep a running \\\\([L,R]\\\\) intersection, and if at the end \\\\(L\\\\le R\\\\) we output \\\\(L\\\\) (the smallest valid country), otherwise \\\\(-1\\\\).\\n\\nBecause \\\\(n\\\\cdot k\\\\le 10^5\\\\), we can afford to store all \\\\(b_{i,j}\\\\) values.  Moreover each query has up to \\\\(m\\\\) requirements, and the total \\\\(\\\\sum m\\\\le10^5\\\\), so doing an \\\\(\\\\,O(\\\\log n)\\\\) binary search for each requirement is perfectly efficient.\\n\\nTo minimize Java‐overhead, we\\n\\n 1. Read the original \\\\(a_{i,j}\\\\) row by row,\\n 2. Maintain an array `prefix[j]` which accumulates the column‐wise OR,\\n 3. Immediately store the result `prefix[j]` into a flattened array `flat[j*n + i] = b[i][j]`.\\n\\nThus `flat` has length \\\\(k\\\\times n\\\\), and for each column \\\\(j\\\\), its data are in `flat[j*n + 0 .. j*n + (n-1)]` in nondecreasing order.

Call that 0-based index \\\\(p\\\\).  Then rows \\\\(\\\\{1,2,\\\\dots,p\\\\}\\\\) (in 1-based) satisfy `<c`.  \\n   - `\\\"> c\\\"` becomes a suffix: we binary‐search for the first index whose value is \\\\(>c\\\\).  Call that 0-based index \\\\(p\\\\).  Then rows \\\\(\\\\{p+1,\\\\dots,n\\\\}\\\\) satisfy `>c`.\\n\\n4. **Intersecting intervals**  \\n   We keep a global \\\\([L,R]\\\\) in 1-based row indices.
