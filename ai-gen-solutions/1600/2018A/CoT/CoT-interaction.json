Cards Partition\n\ntime limit per test2 seconds\n\nmemory limit per test256 megabytes\n\nDJ Genki vs Gram - Einherjar Joker\n\n⠀\n\nYou have some cards. An integer between 1\n\n and n\n\n is written on each card: specifically, for each i\n\n from 1\n\n to n\n\n, you have ai\n\n cards which have the number i\n\n written on them.\n\n\n\nThere is also a shop which contains unlimited cards of each type. You have k\n\n coins, so you can buy at most k\n\n new cards in total, and the cards you buy can contain any integer between 1\n\n and n\n\n, inclusive.\n\n\n\nAfter buying the new cards, you must partition all your cards into decks, according to the following rules:\n\n\n\nall the decks must have the same size;\n\nthere are no pairs of cards with the same value in the same deck.\n\nFind the maximum possible size of a deck after buying cards and partitioning them optimally.\n\n\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t\n\n (1≤t≤104\n\n). The description of the test cases follows.\n\n\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers n\n\n, k\n\n (1≤n≤2⋅105\n\n, 0≤k≤1016\n\n) — the number of distinct types of cards and the number of coins.\n\n\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n\n\n integers a1,a2,…,an\n\n (0≤ai≤1010\n\n, ∑ai≥1\n\n) — the number of cards of type i\n\n you have at the beginning, for each 1≤i≤n\n\n.\n\n\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n\n\n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105\n\n.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single integer: the maximum possible size of a deck if you operate optimally.\n\n\n\nExample\n\nInputCopy\n\n9\n\n3 1\n\n3 2 2\n\n5 4\n\n2 6 1 2 4\n\n2 100\n\n1410065408 10000000000\n\n10 8\n\n7 4 6 6 9 3 10 2 8 7\n\n2 12\n\n2 2\n\n2 70\n\n0 1\n\n1 0\n\n1\n\n3 0\n\n2 1 2\n\n3 1\n\n0 3 3\n\nOutputCopy\n\n2\n\n3\n\n1\n\n7\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, you can buy one card with the number 1\n\n, and your cards become [1,1,1,1,2,2,3,3]\n\n. You can partition them into the decks [1,2],[1,2],[1,3],[1,3]\n\n: they all have size 2\n\n, and they all contain distinct values. You can show that you cannot get a partition with decks of size greater than 2\n\n, so the answer is 2\n\n.\n\n\n\nIn the second test case, you can buy two cards with the number 1\n\n and one card with the number 3\n\n, and your cards become [1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5,5]\n\n, which can be partitioned into [1,2,3],[1,2,4],[1,2,5],[1,2,5],[2,3,5],[2,4,5]\n\n. You can show that you cannot get a partition with decks of size greater than 3\n\n, so the answer is 3\n\n.\n\n---\n\nLet's think step-by-step so we don't make mistakes. Use Java.
