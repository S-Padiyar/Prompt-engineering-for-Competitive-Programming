First, carefully read and restate the problem in your own words to ensure full understanding. Identify the input and output formats, list the constraints, and consider any edge cases that might affect the logic. Next, determine which algorithmic pattern the problem fits best—such as greedy, binary search, two pointers, dynamic programming, or graph traversal—and briefly explain why that pattern applies. Then, plan your solution step by step, describing the key ideas, data structures, or mathematical insights you’ll use. Once your plan is clear, write a clean and fully working Java program. Use import java.util.*; and include a Main class with a main method, using Scanner or BufferedReader for input depending on the constraints. Add comments to explain important logic in the code. After coding, walk through a sample input manually to show how your solution works in practice. Finally, analyze the time and space complexity of your approach using Big-O notation, justifying your answer. Think step by step and only write code once the logic is sound and complete."

We are allowed two things:\\n\\n1. **Shuffle** the array arbitrarily once at the very beginning.\\n2. Perform any number of **operations** of the form  \\n   \\\\[\\n     a_i \\\\;\\\\longleftarrow\\\\; a_i + k,\\\\quad 1\\\\le i\\\\le n.\\n   \\\\]\\n\\nAfter all operations, we call the resulting array \\\\(b\\\\) *beautiful* if it is a palindrome, i.e. \\\\(b_i = b_{n-i+1}\\\\) for all \\\\(i\\\\).  We must find the minimum total number of single-\\\\(+k\\\\) increments needed to make the array beautiful, or decide it is impossible.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Key Observations**\\n\\n1. **Residue Constraint.**  Adding \\\\(k\\\\) does not change an element’s value modulo \\\\(k\\\\).  Thus if two elements end up equal in the palindrome, they must **start** with the same residue \\\\(\\\\bmod\\\\,k\\\\).\\n\\n2. **Pairing via Shuffle.**  Because we can shuffle once before any operations, we effectively get to pair up the elements arbitrarily (except possibly one lone middle element if \\\\(n\\\\) is odd).  Each pair \\\\((x,y)\\\\) must have the same residue mod \\\\(k\\\\), and then we will pay the cost to “level” them to the same final value by repeatedly adding \\\\(k\\\\) to the smaller one until it reaches the larger.  The cost for a pair \\\\((x,y)\\\\) with \\\\(x\\\\le y\\\\) and \\\\(x\\\\equiv y\\\\pmod{k}\\\\) is\\n   \\\\[\\n     \\\\frac{y - x}{k}\\n   \\\\]\\n   increments.\\n\\n3. **Grouping by Residue.**  We group all elements by \\\\(r = a_i \\\\bmod k\\\\).  Inside each residue-class group, we must pair all elements up (except possibly one if \\\\(n\\\\) is odd).  \\n\\n   - If \\\\(n\\\\) is even, **every** group must have even size, otherwise we cannot make a perfect pairing, so the answer is \\\\(-1\\\\).\\n   - If \\\\(n\\\\) is odd, **exactly one** residue group may have odd size (that group contributes the middle palindrome element), and all other groups must be even-sized.  If the count of odd-sized groups is not exactly 1, the answer is \\\\(-1\\\\).\\n\\n4. **Minimizing Pairwise Costs in One Group.**  \\n   - If a residue-group has even size, the minimum total cost of pairing (under cost \\\\(|y-x|\\\\)) is obtained simply by sorting the group and pairing neighbors: \\\\((v_0,v_1), (v_2,v_3),\\\\dots\\\\).  \\n   - If a residue-group has odd size (and is the unique odd group when \\\\(n\\\\) is odd), we must leave exactly one element unpaired (it will become the center of the palindrome).  Among all choices of which single element to leave out, we want the minimum total pairing cost for the rest.  This is a classic one-dimensional “minimum weight almost-perfect matching” problem, solvable in linear time by a small DP:\\n     Let the sorted values be \\\\(v_0\\\\le v_1\\\\le \\\\dots\\\\le v_{m-1}\\\\).  Define two DP arrays\\n     \\\\[\\n       \\\\begin{aligned}\\n         \\\\mathrm{dp0}[i] &\\\\;=\\\\;\\\\text{min cost to perfectly pair up all of }v_0,\\\\dots,v_i\\\\,,\\\\quad(\\\\text{so }i+1\\\\text{ must be even}),\\\\\\\\\\n         \\\\mathrm{dp1}[i] &\\\\;=\\\\;\\\\text{min cost to pair up exactly one of }v_0,\\\\dots,v_i\\\\text{ as the leftover (so }i+1\\\\text{ is odd).}\\n       \\\\end{aligned}\\n     \\\\]\\n     Transitions (for \\\\(i\\\\ge1\\\\)):\\n     - **Pair** \\\\((v_{i-1},v_i)\\\\):  \\n       \\\\(\\\\displaystyle\\\\mathrm{cost} = \\\\frac{v_i - v_{i-1}}{k}.\\\\)  \\n       Then\\n       \\\\[\\n         \\\\mathrm{dp0}[i] = \\\\mathrm{dp0}[i-2] + \\\\text{cost},\\\\quad\\n         \\\\mathrm{dp1}[i] = \\\\mathrm{dp1}[i-2] + \\\\text{cost}.\\n       \\\\]\\n       (We adopt the convention \\\\(\\\\mathrm{dp0}[-1]=0\\\\), \\\\(\\\\mathrm{dp1}[-1]=\\\\infty\\\\).)\\n     - **Leave \\\\(v_i\\\\) unmatched** (becomes the middle):  \\n       \\\\[\\n         \\\\mathrm{dp1}[i] = \\\\min\\\\bigl(\\\\mathrm{dp1}[i],\\\\;\\\\mathrm{dp0}[i-1]\\\\bigr).\\n       \\\\]\\n     At the end, if the group size \\\\(m\\\\) is even we take \\\\(\\\\mathrm{dp0}[m-1]\\\\);
