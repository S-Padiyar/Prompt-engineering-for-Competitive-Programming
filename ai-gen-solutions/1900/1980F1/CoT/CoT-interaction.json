Field Division (easy version)\n\ntime limit per test3 seconds\n\nmemory limit per test256 megabytes\n\nThis is an easy version of the problem; it differs from the hard version only by the question. The easy version only needs you to print whether some values are non-zero or not. The hard version needs you to print the exact values.\n\n\n\nAlice and Bob are dividing the field. The field is a rectangle of size n×m\n\n (2≤n,m≤109\n\n), the rows are numbered from 1\n\n to n\n\n from top to bottom, and the columns are numbered from 1\n\n to m\n\n from left to right. The cell at the intersection of row r\n\n and column c\n\n is denoted as (r,c\n\n).\n\n\n\nBob has k\n\n (2≤k≤2⋅105\n\n) fountains, all of them are located in different cells of the field. Alice is responsible for dividing the field, but she must meet several conditions:\n\n\n\nTo divide the field, Alice will start her path in any free (without a fountain) cell on the left or top side of the field and will move, each time moving to the adjacent cell down or right. Her path will end on the right or bottom side of the field.\n\nAlice's path will divide the field into two parts — one part will belong to Alice (this part includes the cells of her path), the other part — to Bob.\n\nAlice will own the part that includes the cell (n,1\n\n).\n\nBob will own the part that includes the cell (1,m\n\n).\n\nAlice wants to divide the field in such a way as to get as many cells as possible.\n\n\n\nBob wants to keep ownership of all the fountains, but he can give one of them to Alice. First, output the integer α\n\n — the maximum possible size of Alice's plot, if Bob does not give her any fountain (i.e., all fountains will remain on Bob's plot). Then output k\n\n non-negative integers a1,a2,…,ak\n\n, where:\n\n\n\nai=0\n\n, if after Bob gives Alice the i\n\n-th fountain, the maximum possible size of Alice's plot does not increase (i.e., remains equal to α\n\n);\n\nai=1\n\n, if after Bob gives Alice the i\n\n-th fountain, the maximum possible size of Alice's plot increases (i.e., becomes greater than α\n\n).\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t\n\n (1≤t≤104\n\n) — the number of test cases.\n\n\n\nThe first line of each test case contains three integers n\n\n, m\n\n, and k\n\n (2≤n,m≤109\n\n, 2≤k≤2⋅105\n\n) — the field sizes and the number of fountains, respectively.\n\n\n\nThen follow k\n\n lines, each containing two numbers ri\n\n and ci\n\n (1≤ri≤n\n\n, 1≤ci≤m\n\n) — the coordinates of the cell with the i\n\n-th fountain. It is guaranteed that all cells are distinct and none of them is (n,1\n\n).\n\n\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of k\n\n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105\n\n.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, first output α\n\n — the maximum size of the plot that can belong to Alice if Bob does not give her any of the fountains. Then output k\n\n non-negative integers a1,a2,…,ak\n\n, where:\n\n\n\nai=0\n\n, if after Bob gives Alice the i\n\n-th fountain, the maximum possible size of Alice's plot does not increase compared to the case when all k\n\n fountains belong to Bob;\n\nai=1\n\n, if after Bob gives Alice the i\n\n-th fountain, the maximum possible size of Alice's plot increases compared to the case when all k\n\n fountains belong to Bob.\n\nIf you output any other positive number instead of 1\n\n that fits into a 64-bit signed integer type, it will also be recognized as 1\n\n. Thus, a solution to the hard version of this problem will also pass the tests for the easy version.\n\n\n\nExample\n\nInputCopy\n\n5\n\n2 2 3\n\n1 1\n\n1 2\n\n2 2\n\n5 5 4\n\n1 2\n\n2 2\n\n3 4\n\n4 3\n\n2 5 9\n\n1 2\n\n1 5\n\n1 1\n\n2 2\n\n2 4\n\n2 5\n\n1 4\n\n2 3\n\n1 3\n\n6 4 4\n\n6 2\n\n1 3\n\n1 4\n\n1 2\n\n3 4 5\n\n2 1\n\n3 2\n\n1 4\n\n1 3\n\n2 4\n\nOutputCopy\n\n1\n\n1 0 1 \n\n11\n\n0 1 0 1 \n\n1\n\n0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 \n\n6\n\n1 0 0 0 \n\n1\n\n1 1 0 0 0 \n\nNote\n\nBelow are the images for the second example:\n\n\n\nThe indices of the fountains are labeled in green.

Alice must draw a monotone path (only steps “right” or “down” in the usual matrix‐coordinates sense) from the top or left edge to the bottom or right edge; the path and everything “south–west” of it (including the path itself) belongs to Alice, and the rest belongs to Bob.  Bob initially wants all fountains in his region.  We want:\\n\\n1.  \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) = the maximum number of cells Alice can claim if **no** fountain goes to Alice.\\n2.  For each fountain \\\\(i\\\\), whether giving that one fountain to Alice (so it no longer constrains Bob’s region) would strictly increase Alice’s max—i.e. does \\\\(\\\\alpha_i>\\\\alpha\\\\)?  We output `1` if it does, `0` otherwise.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Key observations**\\n\\n1.  A “fountain” at column \\\\(x\\\\), row \\\\(r\\\\) (we will reindex so that row increases **upwards**) forces the path to stay below it in that column.  Equivalently, in each column \\\\(x\\\\), let\\n   \\\\[\\n     y_{\\\\min}(x)=\\\\min\\\\{\\\\,y_i\\\\mid\\\\text{fountain at column }x\\\\},\\n   \\\\]\\n   (where \\\\(y_i\\\\) is the “upwards”‐reindexed row).  Then the path at column \\\\(x\\\\) can be at height at most \\\\(y_{\\\\min}(x)-1\\\\).  \\n\\n2.  Moreover, as we sweep columns \\\\(x=1,2,\\\\dots,m\\\\) from left to right, we keep a running “global” minimum\\n   \\\\[\\n     \\\\mathsf{curY}\\n     = \\\\min\\\\bigl(n+1,\\\\;y_{\\\\min}(1),\\\\;y_{\\\\min}(2),\\\\dots,y_{\\\\min}(x)\\\\bigr).\\n   \\\\]\\n   Before seeing any fountain, \\\\(\\\\mathsf{curY}=n+1\\\\), so the path can sit at height \\\\(n\\\\) (i.e.\\\\ the very top row).  As soon as we see a fountain in some column whose \\\\(y_{\\\\min}\\\\) is lower than all before, \\\\(\\\\mathsf{curY}\\\\) drops, and the path from that column onwards is forced lower.\\n\\n3.  The **area** under the path (the number of cells Alice claims) is\\n   \\\\[\\n     \\\\sum_{x=1}^m \\\\bigl(\\\\mathsf{curY}(x)-1\\\\bigr),\\n   \\\\]\\n   where \\\\(\\\\mathsf{curY}(x)\\\\) is the value of \\\\(\\\\mathsf{curY}\\\\) *after* processing column \\\\(x\\\\)'s fountain‐constraint (or unchanged if there is no fountain in column \\\\(x\\\\)).\\n\\n4.  Only those fountains whose column‐minimum actually *updates* the running minimum (i.e.\\\\ strictly decreases \\\\(\\\\mathsf{curY}\\\\)) are ever “active” in constraining the path.  Removing (giving to Alice) any other fountain does not change \\\\(\\\\mathsf{curY}\\\\) at all, hence does not change the maximum area \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\).  But if you remove one that *did* strictly lower \\\\(\\\\mathsf{curY}\\\\), then \\\\(\\\\mathsf{curY}\\\\) stays higher for all columns up to the next drop, and the total area strictly *increases*.\\n\\nThus the solution is:\\n\\n1.  For each column \\\\(x\\\\) that has at least one fountain, pick the fountain with the *smallest* reindexed‐row \\\\(y\\\\).  Call its pair \\\\((x,y)\\\\).\\n2.  Sort these “column‐minima” by \\\\(x\\\\).  Sweep left→right, maintaining \\\\(\\\\mathsf{curY}\\\\).  Whenever \\\\(y<\\\\mathsf{curY}\\\\), that column‐fountain is a “record” and *strictly* lowers \\\\(\\\\mathsf{curY}\\\\); we mark its fountain‐ID with a `1`.  Otherwise we mark `0`.\\n3.  In the same sweep we accumulate the area\\n   \\\\[\\n     \\\\alpha \\\\;=\\\\;\\\\sum_{x=1}^m\\\\bigl(\\\\mathsf{curY}(x)-1\\\\bigr),\\n   \\\\]\\n   by noting that between two columns where \\\\(\\\\mathsf{curY}\\\\) is constant one can multiply height by width, and at the exact column of a fountain one uses the *new* \\\\(\\\\mathsf{curY}\\\\).\\n\\nComplexity:  We group fountains by column in \\\\(O(k)\\\\), pick the column‐min in \\\\(O(k)\\\\), sort these at \\\\(O(k\\\\log k)\\\\), then do one \\\\(O(k)\\\\) sweep.

We convert each fountain’s \\\\((r,c)\\\\) to \\\\((x,y)\\\\) where  \\n   \\\\[\\n     x = c,\\\\quad y = n - r + 1\\n   \\\\]\\n   so that \\\\(y\\\\) increases upward (row =n is bottom → y=1, row =1 is top → y=n).\\n\\n2. In each column \\\\(x\\\\) we only need the *smallest* \\\\(y\\\\)-value (i.e.\\\\ the fountain that forces the path lowest in that column).  We sort all fountains by \\\\((x,y)\\\\), then scan to pick out one “column‐minimum” per \\\\(x\\\\).\\n\\n3. Sort those column‐minima by \\\\(x\\\\).  We sweep \\\\(x=1\\\\) to \\\\(m\\\\).  We keep a variable \\\\(\\\\mathsf{curY}\\\\), initially \\\\(n+1\\\\).  Before any fountain, Alice’s path can be at height \\\\(n\\\\).  Whenever we hit a column‐min with \\\\(y_{\\\\min}<\\\\mathsf{curY}\\\\), that fountain *strictly* lowers the ceiling to \\\\(y_{\\\\min}\\\\), and we mark it `1` because removing that fountain would restore a higher ceiling (and thus increase Alice’s area).  All other fountains are `0`.\\n\\n4. We accumulate\\n   \\\\[\\n     \\\\sum_{x=1}^m \\\\bigl(\\\\mathsf{curY}(x)-1\\\\bigr)\\n   \\\\]\\n   by noticing that between two successive “event” columns where \\\\(\\\\mathsf{curY}\\\\) jumps, the height is constant, so we do a rectangle‐area width–times–height; and at the exact column of an event we also add \\\\((\\\\mathsf{curY}-1)\\\\) *after* updating \\\\(\\\\mathsf{curY}\\\\).\\n\\nThis runs in \\\\(O(k\\\\log k)\\\\) per test (to sort) and easily handles \\\\(\\\\sum k\\\\le2\\\\cdot10^5\\\\).\",\n        \"refusal\": null,\n        \"role\": \"assistant\",\n        \"annotations\": [],\n        \"audio\": null,\n        \"function_call\": null,\n        \"tool_calls\": null\n      },\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"protected_material_code\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": true,\n          \"citation\": {\n            \"URL\": \"https://github.com/dilarame/D1/tree/91887f273da9c73bf9be4bf8142c05614b68fb3e/mccme%2Fproblem54%2FSolution.java\",\n            \"license\": \"NOASSERTION\"\n          }\n        },\n        \"protected_material_text\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"created\": 1753309975,\n  \"model\": \"o4-mini-2025-04-16\",\n  \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n  \"service_tier\": null,\n  \"system_fingerprint\": null,\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"completion_tokens\": 13302,\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 1124,\n    \"total_tokens\": 14426,\n    \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n      \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"reasoning_tokens\": 10816,\n      \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n    },\n    \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"cached_tokens\": 1024\n    }\n  },\n  \"prompt_filter_results\": [\n    {\n      \"prompt_index\": 0,\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"jailbreak\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
