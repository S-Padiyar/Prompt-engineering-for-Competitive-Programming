Dyn-scripted Robot (Easy Version)\n\ntime limit per test3 seconds\n\nmemory limit per test256 megabytes\n\nThis is the easy version of the problem. The only difference is that in this version k≤n\n\n. You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved.\n\n\n\nGiven a w×h\n\n rectangle on the Oxy\n\n plane, with points (0,0)\n\n at the bottom-left and (w,h)\n\n at the top-right of the rectangle.\n\n\n\nYou also have a robot initially at point (0,0)\n\n and a script s\n\n of n\n\n characters. Each character is either L, R, U, or D, which tells the robot to move left, right, up, or down respectively.\n\n\n\nThe robot can only move inside the rectangle; otherwise, it will change the script s\n\n as follows:\n\n\n\nIf it tries to move outside a vertical border, it changes all L characters to R's (and vice versa, all R's to L's).\n\nIf it tries to move outside a horizontal border, it changes all U characters to D's (and vice versa, all D's to U's).\n\nThen, it will execute the changed script starting from the character which it couldn't execute.\n\n\n\nAn example of the robot's movement process, s=\"ULULURD\"\n\nThe script s\n\n will be executed for k\n\n times continuously. All changes to the string s\n\n will be retained even when it is repeated. During this process, how many times will the robot move to the point (0,0)\n\n in total? Note that the initial position does NOT count.\n\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t\n\n (1≤t≤104\n\n) — the number of test cases.\n\n\n\nThe first line of each test case contains four integers n\n\n, k\n\n, w\n\n, and h\n\n (1≤n,w,h≤106\n\n; 1≤k≤n\n\n).\n\n\n\nThe second line contains a single string s\n\n of size n\n\n (si∈{L,R,U,D}\n\n) — the script to be executed.\n\n\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n\n\n over all test cases does not exceed 106\n\n.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print a single integer — the number of times the robot reaches (0,0)\n\n when executing script s\n\n for k\n\n times continuously.\n\n\n\nExample\n\nInputCopy\n\n5\n\n2 2 2 2\n\nUR\n\n4 2 1 1\n\nLLDD\n\n6 3 3 1\n\nRLRRRL\n\n5 5 3 3\n\nRUURD\n\n7 5 3 4\n\nRRDLUUU\n\nOutputCopy\n\n0\n\n4\n\n3\n\n0\n\n1\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, the robot only moves up and right. In the end, it occupies the position (2,2)\n\n but never visits (0,0)\n\n. So the answer is 0\n\n.\n\n\n\nIn the second test case, each time executing the script the robot visits the origin twice. And since k=2\n\n, it visits the origin 2⋅2=4\n\n times overall.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the third test case, the visualization is shown as below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\nUse Java."

The main idea is:\\n\\n 1.  We maintain two “flip” bits  \\n     flipLR (whether L⇄R has been flipped an odd number of times)  \\n     flipUD (whether U⇄D has been flipped an odd number of times)  \\n 2.  For each of the 4 possible flip‐states S=(flipLR,flipUD), we precompute on the original script s (length n):  \\n     – dxS[i], dyS[i] = the prefix sums of x‐ and y‐movement through the first i commands assuming we are in state S.  \\n     – minDxS, maxDxS = the minimum and maximum of {dxS[1…n]}.  (Similarly minDyS, maxDyS.)  \\n     – sumDxS=dxS[n], sumDyS=dyS[n] (total displacement).  \\n     – an unordered_map zeroCountS that counts, for each pair (dx,dy) among the prefixes, how many i have (dxS[i],dyS[i])==(dx,dy).  \\n 3.  In the actual walk we keep track of current (x,y), current state S, and how many full script‐repetitions remain (r=k down to 0).  \\n     – As long as the entire remaining script s (in state S) never drives us out of the [0…w]×[0…h] box  \\n       i.e.  x+minDxS≥0, x+maxDxS≤w, y+minDyS≥0, y+maxDyS≤h  —  then we can “bulk‐apply” all r runs in O(1):  \\n         •  add to the answer  r * zeroCountS.getOrDefault((-x, -y),0)  \\n         •  advance  x+=r*sumDxS,  y+=r*sumDyS  \\n         •  set r=0 and break.  \\n     – Otherwise there must be at least one boundary‐hit in the next copy of s.  We find the first i (by a tiny O(n) scan from 1…n) which would push us out of bounds, we simulate the first (i−1) steps one‐by‐one (updating x,y, counting any visits to (0,0)), then at step i we “flip” the offending dimension’s bit (LR or UD), do not move, and continue at the same s‐index i with the new flip‐state.  \\n 4.  It can be shown that after at most a couple of these “first‐hit‐and‐flip” partial passes we reach a flip‐state for which the whole script becomes safe and we bulk finish all remaining r in one O(1) move.  \\n\\nSince each of the partial “walk until first hit” scans across at most n commands, and we do only O(1) such partial scans (after that we bulk‐finish), the total is O(n) per test.  All of the bookkeeping (prefix sums, min/max, hash‐maps) is O(n), and we only loop linearly through s a small constant number of times.\\n\\n```java\\nimport java.io.*;\\nimport java.util.*;\\n\\npublic class Main {\\n    static final long INF = (long)1e18;\\n\\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\\n        BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));\\n        PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(new BufferedWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(System.out)));\\n\\n        int T = Integer.parseInt(in.readLine());\\n        while (T-- > 0) {\\n            String[] tok = in.readLine().split(\\\" \\\");\\n            int n = Integer.parseInt(tok[0]);\\n            int k = Integer.parseInt(tok[1]);\\n            int w = Integer.parseInt(tok[2]);\\n            int h = Integer.parseInt(tok[3]);\\n            String s = in.readLine();\\n\\n            // We will build for each of the 4 flip‐states S = 0..3\\n            // state bit0 = flipLR, bit1 = flipUD\\n            long[][] dx = new long[4][n+1], dy = new long[4][n+1];\\n            long[] minDx = new long[4], maxDx = new long[4], minDy = new long[4], maxDy = new long[4];\\n            long[] sumDx = new long[4], sumDy = new long[4];\\n            @SuppressWarnings(\\\"unchecked\\\")\\n            HashMap<Long,Integer>[] zeroCnt = new HashMap[4];\\n\\n            // Precompute for each state\\n            for (int st = 0; st < 4; st++) {\\n                boolean fLR = (st & 1) != 0;\\n                boolean fUD = (st & 2) != 0;\\n                zeroCnt[st] = new HashMap<>();\\n                minDx[st] = minDy[st] = 0;\\n                maxDx[st] = maxDy[st] = 0;\\n                dx[st][0] = 0;\\n                dy[st][0] = 0;\\n                for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\\n                    char c = s.charAt(i-1);\\n                    long ddx=0, ddy=0;\\n                    switch(c) {\\n                        case 'L': ddx = fLR ?

We never actually mutate the string s.  Instead we remember two bits `flipLR` and `flipUD` that tell us whether we should interpret an `L` as `R`, etc.  That allows us to precompute in O(4n) all 4 possible “flip‐states” of s.\\n\\n2. For each state `S` we store  \\n   – `dx[S][i], dy[S][i]`: the prefix sums after `i` commands,  \\n   – `minDx[S], maxDx[S], minDy[S], maxDy[S]`: the global min/max over those prefixes,  \\n   – `sumDx[S]=dx[S][n], sumDy[S]=dy[S][n]` the total displacement,  \\n   – a hash map counting how many prefixes land you at exactly `(dx,dy)`.  In particular prefixes that land you at `(-x,-y)` correspond to visits to `(0,0)` when your start was `(x,y)`.\\n\\n3. In the actual walk we keep current `(x,y)`, current flip‐state `S`, and how many full copies of `s` remain, `runs=k`.\\n\\n4. We do at most a constant (say 3) partial passes through `s` where each pass finds the first illegal step, simulates up to that point, flips one bit and restarts the pass.  After that at least one of the 4 states must become “completely safe” (i.e. the whole script from  start to end never goes out of the box).  Once we detect that full‐safety we jump in O(1)—we look up in our precomputed map how many visits to `(0,0)` a single run would produce, multiply by the remaining runs, and finish.\\n\\nSince each partial pass is O(n) and we do only a few of them, plus the O(n) precomputation, the overall time per test is O(n).  Under the easy constraint `k≤n` and sum of all `n` up to 10^6 this runs in time.\",\n        \"refusal\": null,\n        \"role\": \"assistant\",\n        \"annotations\": [],\n        \"audio\": null,\n        \"function_call\": null,\n        \"tool_calls\": null\n      },\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"protected_material_code\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": true,\n          \"citation\": {\n            \"URL\": \"https://github.com/kmilichus/Maratones/tree/330415d031fb5921447a2edf934b6d6ddf87295e/src%2FCodeJam%2F2017%2FBathroomStalls.java\",\n            \"license\": \"NOASSERTION\"\n          }\n        },\n        \"protected_material_text\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"created\": 1753310635,\n  \"model\": \"o4-mini-2025-04-16\",\n  \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n  \"service_tier\": null,\n  \"system_fingerprint\": null,\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"completion_tokens\": 16727,\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 672,\n    \"total_tokens\": 17399,\n    \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n      \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"reasoning_tokens\": 13952,\n      \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n    },\n    \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"cached_tokens\": 0\n    }\n  },\n  \"prompt_filter_results\": [\n    {\n      \"prompt_index\": 0,\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"jailbreak\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
