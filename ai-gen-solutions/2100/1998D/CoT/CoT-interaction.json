Determine Winning Islands in Race\n\ntime limit per test2 seconds\n\nmemory limit per test256 megabytes\n\nMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO\n\n— Bessie the Cow, The Art of Racing on Islands\n\nTwo of Farmer John's cows, Bessie and Elsie, are planning to race on n\n\n islands. There are n−1\n\n main bridges, connecting island i\n\n to island i+1\n\n for all 1≤i≤n−1\n\n. Additionally, there are m\n\n alternative bridges. Elsie can use both main and alternative bridges, while Bessie can only use main bridges. All bridges are one way and can only be used to travel from an island with a lower index to an island with a higher index.\n\n\n\nInitially, Elsie starts on island 1\n\n, and Bessie starts on island s\n\n. The cows alternate turns, with Bessie making the first turn. Suppose the cow is on island i\n\n. During a cow's turn, if there are any bridges connecting island i\n\n to island j\n\n, then the cow can move to island j\n\n. Then, island i\n\n collapses, and all bridges connecting to island i\n\n also collapse. Also, note the following:\n\n\n\nIf there are no bridges connecting island i\n\n to another island, then island i\n\n collapses, and this cow is eliminated from the race.\n\nIf the other cow is also on island i\n\n, then after this cow moves to another island, the island collapses, and the other cow is eliminated from the race.\n\nAfter an island or bridge collapses, no cows may use them.\n\nIf a cow is eliminated, their turn is skipped for the rest of the race.\n\nThe race ends once either cow reaches island n\n\n. It can be shown that regardless of the cows' strategies, at least one cow reaches island n\n\n. Bessie wins if and only if she reaches island n\n\n first.\n\n\n\nFor each 1≤s≤n−1\n\n, determine whether Bessie wins if she starts the race on island s\n\n. Assume both cows follow optimal strategies to ensure their own respective victories.\n\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains t\n\n (1≤t≤104\n\n) – the number of test cases.\n\n\n\nThe first line of each test case contains n\n\n and m\n\n (2≤n≤2⋅105\n\n, 0≤m≤2⋅105\n\n) – the number of islands and the number of alternative bridges.\n\n\n\nThe next m\n\n lines of each test case contain u\n\n and v\n\n (1≤u<v≤n\n\n) – the islands that the alternative bridge connects. It is guaranteed all alternative bridges are distinct, and they do not coincide with the main bridges.\n\n\n\nIt is guaranteed that neither the sum of n\n\n nor the sum of m\n\n over all test cases exceeds 2⋅105\n\n.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a binary string of length n−1\n\n on a new line. The i\n\n'th character is 1\n\n if it is possible for Bessie to win if she starts on island i\n\n. Otherwise, it is 0\n\n.\n\n\n\nExample\n\nInputCopy\n\n5\n\n6 0\n\n6 1\n\n2 6\n\n6 1\n\n1 5\n\n10 4\n\n1 3\n\n1 6\n\n2 7\n\n3 8\n\n15 3\n\n2 8\n\n4 9\n\n8 15\n\nOutputCopy\n\n11111\n\n11011\n\n10011\n\n100001111\n\n11000111000111\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, there are no alternative bridges for Elsie to overtake Bessie and reach island n\n\n first, so Bessie will win on all islands because she always moves first.\n\n\n\nIn the second case, Bessie will lose if she starts on island 3\n\n because:\n\n\n\nBessie's Turn: Take a main bridge from island 3\n\n to island 4\n\n.\n\nElsie's Turn: Take a main bridge from island 1\n\n to island 2\n\n.\n\nBessie's Turn: Take a main bridge from island 4\n\n to island 5\n\n.\n\nElsie's Turn: Take an alternative bridge from island 2\n\n to island 6\n\n.

Elsie (the faster cow) may use *all* bridges; Bessie only the main ones.  Initially Elsie is on island 1, Bessie on island \\\\(s\\\\), and they alternate moves, Bessie first.  On her move a cow **must** follow an outgoing bridge if one exists; then whatever island she just left collapses (and so do all bridges into or out of it).  If a cow ever has no outgoing bridge on her turn, her island collapses and she is eliminated.  The race ends as soon as *either* cow reaches island \\\\(n\\\\), and Bessie “wins” if and only if she manages to reach \\\\(n\\\\) strictly before Elsie does.\\n\\nA crucial simplification:\\n\\n1.  **Bessie's path is forced.**  She can only go \\\\(s\\\\to s+1\\\\to\\\\cdots\\\\to n\\\\), one step on each Bessie's turn, collapsing the island she departed.\\n\\n2.  **Elsie’s victory condition** is that she can find some path of \\\\(L\\\\) moves from \\\\(1\\\\) to \\\\(n\\\\) (using main+alternative bridges) so that she reaches \\\\(n\\\\) strictly before Bessie.  \\n   -  Bessie will reach \\\\(n\\\\) in exactly \\\\((n-s)\\\\) of *her* moves, i.e.\\\\ at global time \\\\(2\\\\,(n-s)-1\\\\).  \\n   -  Elsie needs to reach in at most \\\\(L\\\\) of *her* moves, i.e.\\\\ at time \\\\(2L\\\\).

However, any island \\\\(i\\\\) that Bessie visits (and leaves) is collapsed (and stays collapsed) thereafter, so Elsie cannot use any bridge *out* of such an \\\\(i\\\\) after Bessie has passed it.  In particular an alternative bridge \\\\(u\\\\to v\\\\) is only safely usable by Elsie if she uses it *before* Bessie collapses \\\\(u\\\\).  Since Bessie starts at \\\\(s\\\\) and on her \\\\(k\\\\)-th move goes from island \\\\((s+k-1)\\\\to (s+k)\\\\) collapsing \\\\((s+k-1)\\\\), by Elsie’s \\\\(k\\\\)-th move the set of collapsed “Bessie‐left‐behind” islands is\\n\\\\[\\n  \\\\{\\\\,s,\\\\,s+1,\\\\,\\\\dots,\\\\,s+k-1\\\\}.\\n\\\\]\\nHence Elsie may only use an alternative bridge \\\\(u\\\\to v\\\\) *if and only if* \\\\(u<s\\\\).  Any bridge whose start \\\\(u\\\\ge s\\\\) will have been collapsed before Elsie’s chance to use it.\\n\\nPutting everything together, for each starting point \\\\(s\\\\) of Bessie:\\n\\n- Elsie must find a path   \\\\(1=u_{0}\\\\to u_{1}\\\\to\\\\cdots\\\\to u_{L}=n\\\\)\\n  of length \\\\(L\\\\) using\\n  1) main bridges (costing 1 move each, from \\\\(i\\\\to i+1\\\\)) and\\n  2) alternative bridges \\\\(u\\\\to v\\\\) (also costing 1 move),\\n  \\n  such that\\n  (i) she reaches \\\\(n\\\\) in \\\\(L\\\\le n-s-1\\\\) moves, and  \\n  (ii) *every* alternative bridge \\\\(u\\\\to v\\\\) in her path has \\\\(u<s\\\\).\\n\\n- Bessie *loses* (Elsie wins) if such a path exists; otherwise Bessie *wins*.\\n\\nIt turns out that in such a path it is irrelevant exactly *where* Elsie inserts her main steps between alternative edges.  One checks that the total number of moves for Elsie is\\n\\\\[\\n   L \\\\;=\\\\;(\\\\text{main‐steps})+(\\\\text{alt‐edges})\\n   \\\\;=\\\\;\\\\bigl(n-1 -\\\\sum_j(v_j - u_j)\\\\bigr)+(\\\\#\\\\hbox{alt‐edges})\\n   \\\\;=\\\\;n-1 \\\\;-\\\\;\\\\Bigl(\\\\sum_j\\\\bigl((v_j-u_j)-1\\\\bigr)\\\\Bigr).\\n\\\\]\\nDefine the “gain” of using an alternative bridge \\\\(u\\\\to v\\\\) by\\n\\\\[\\n   w = (v-u)-1.\\n\\\\]\\nThen if Elsie uses a sequence of such alt‐bridges of total gain\\n\\\\(\\\\sum_j w_j = W\\\\), her total moves \\\\(L = (n-1)-W\\\\).  She requires\\n\\\\[\\n   L \\\\le n-s-1 \\n   \\\\quad\\\\Longleftrightarrow\\\\quad\\n   (n-1)-W \\\\le n-s-1\\n   \\\\quad\\\\Longleftrightarrow\\\\quad\\n   W \\\\ge s.\\n\\\\]\\nMoreover each alt‐bridge she uses must have its start­point \\\\(u<s\\\\).  Hence\\nfor each \\\\(s\\\\) we look *only* at those alternative bridges with \\\\(u<s\\\\),\\nand ask whether, from \\\\(1\\\\) to \\\\(n\\\\), one can collect total gain\\n\\\\(\\\\ge s\\\\) along some walk that may also use the main chain \\\\(i\\\\to i+1\\\\)\\n(any time), but **never** uses any alternative \\\\(u\\\\to v\\\\) with \\\\(u\\\\ge s\\\\).\\n\\nThis becomes a single‐source longest‐path‐in‐DAG problem with **incremental** insertion\\nof edges, as \\\\(s\\\\) grows from \\\\(1\\\\) to \\\\(n\\\\!-\\\\!1\\\\).\\n\\n- We process \\\\(s=1,2,\\\\dots,n-1\\\\) in order.\\n- We maintain an array \\\\(\\\\mathit{dp}[i]\\\\) = maximum total gain achievable\\n  from \\\\(1\\\\) to island \\\\(i\\\\), using *only* the alt‐edges whose start\\n  \\\\(u<s\\\\).  We also allow arbitrarily many uses of the main edges\\n  \\\\((i\\\\to i+1)\\\\) which carry zero gain; this has the effect that\\n  \\\\(\\\\mathit{dp}[i]\\\\) is always non‐decreasing in \\\\(i\\\\), because\\n  one can always “coast” from \\\\(i\\\\) to \\\\(i+1\\\\) without losing total gain.\\n- Initially for \\\\(s=1\\\\) we have no alt‐edge with \\\\(u<1\\\\), so\\n  \\\\(\\\\mathit{dp}[i]\\\\equiv 0\\\\).\\n-  When we move from \\\\(s\\\\) to \\\\(s+1\\\\), we *add* all alternative edges\\n  \\\\((u\\\\to v)\\\\) with \\\\(u=s\\\\).  For each such edge we have gain\\n  \\\\(w=v-u-1\\\\).  We see if it improves \\\\(\\\\mathit{dp}[v]\\\\);\\n  if \\\\(\\\\mathit{dp}[u]+w > \\\\mathit{dp}[v]\\\\), we raise \\\\(\\\\mathit{dp}[v]\\\\)\\n  to that new value, and --- because \\\\(\\\\mathit{dp}\\\\) must stay non‐decreasing\\n  in \\\\(i\\\\) (we can always use zero‐gain main edges to coast rightward) ---\\n  we “spread” that improved value rightward until it meets or exceeds\\n  itself somewhere.\\n\\nAfter all insertions for this \\\\(s\\\\) we look at \\\\(\\\\mathit{dp}[n]\\\\).  Elsie\\ncan win precisely if \\\\(\\\\mathit{dp}[n]\\\\ge s\\\\), meaning she has gathered\\ngain at least \\\\(s\\\\) by the time she reaches \\\\(n\\\\).  Hence Bessie wins\\n(\\\\(=1\\\\)) if and only if \\\\(\\\\mathit{dp}[n]<s\\\\).\\n\\nWe implement a segment‐tree over \\\\(\\\\mathit{dp}[1..n]\\\\) supporting\\n1) point‐query \\\\(\\\\mathit{dp}[u]\\\\),  \\n2) range‐update “set all \\\\(\\\\mathit{dp}[i]\\\\gets X\\\\) for \\\\(i\\\\in[v..r]\\\\)”\\n   but only when \\\\(X\\\\) is larger than the previous entries there,\\n3) a search for the first index \\\\(\\\\ge v\\\\) whose \\\\(\\\\mathit{dp}[\\\\cdot]\\\\)\\n   already exceeds or meets \\\\(X\\\\).  \\n\\nAll these operations can be done in \\\\(O(\\\\log n)\\\\).  Since each\\nalternative bridge is processed exactly once (when its \\\\(u\\\\) becomes\\n\\\\(<s\\\\)), the total complexity per test is\\n\\\\[\\n   O\\\\bigl((n + m)\\\\,\\\\log n\\\\bigr),\\n\\\\]\\nand the total over all tests is fine for \\\\(n,m\\\\le2\\\\times10^5\\\\).\\n\\n---\\n\\n```java\\nimport java.io.*;\\nimport java.util.*;\\n\\npublic class Main {\\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\\n        BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));\\n        int t = Integer.parseInt(in.readLine().trim());\\n        // We'll need up to sum(n) <= 2e5, so we size arrays generously.\\n        int MAX = 200_000 + 5;\\n\\n        // adjacency of alt-edges by their start u\\n        ArrayList<int[]>[] byStart = new ArrayList[MAX];\\n        for(int i = 0;

We store all *alternative* bridges in lists by their starting island `u`.\\n2.  We keep a “dp‐array” \\\\(\\\\mathit{dp}[1..n]\\\\) in a segment tree, where\\n   \\\\(\\\\mathit{dp}[i]\\\\) = the maximal total “gain” Elsie can have upon reaching island \\\\(i\\\\),\\n   *using only* the alt‐edges whose start \\\\(u\\\\) is already \\\\(<s\\\\).  We also allow\\n   unlimited 0‐gain main‐chain moves, so \\\\(\\\\mathit{dp}[i]\\\\) is non‐decreasing in \\\\(i\\\\).\\n3.  We sweep Bessie’s start \\\\(s=1,2,\\\\dots,n-1\\\\).  When we move from \\\\(s\\\\) to \\\\(s+1\\\\),\\n   we now \\\"unlock\\\" all alternative bridges with start \\\\(u=s\\\\).  For each such\\n   bridge \\\\(u\\\\to v\\\\) with gain \\\\(w=(v-u)-1\\\\), we see if\\n   \\\\(\\\\mathit{dp}[u]+w\\\\) improves \\\\(\\\\mathit{dp}[v]\\\\); if so, we set\\n   \\\\(\\\\mathit{dp}[v]\\\\gets \\\\mathit{dp}[u]+w\\\\), and then since we must maintain\\n   monotonicity \\\\(\\\\mathit{dp}[i]\\\\le \\\\mathit{dp}[i+1]\\\\), we “push” that\\n   improvement rightward until we hit an index whose value already is\\n   \\\\(\\\\ge \\\\mathit{dp}[v]\\\\).\\n4.  Once all new edges for that \\\\(s\\\\) have been processed, we look at\\n   \\\\(\\\\mathit{dp}[n]\\\\).  If \\\\(\\\\mathit{dp}[n]\\\\ge s\\\\), Elsie can gather gain\\n   \\\\(\\\\ge s\\\\), so she can finish in \\\\(\\\\le(n-1)-s\\\\) moves and thus beat Bessie.\\n   In that case Bessie’s answer bit is `0`.  Otherwise the bit is `1`.\\n\\nAll heavy operations (range‐updates, range‐max‐queries, finding the first\\nposition \\\\(\\\\ge v\\\\) whose value ≥ a threshold) are done in \\\\(O(\\\\log n)\\\\) with\\na standard lazy‐segment tree.  Since each of the \\\\(m\\\\) alternative edges is\\nhandled exactly once, the total time per test is\\n\\\\(\\\\;O((n+m)\\\\log n)\\\\), which easily fits under the given limits.\",\n        \"refusal\": null,\n        \"role\": \"assistant\",\n        \"annotations\": [],\n        \"audio\": null,\n        \"function_call\": null,\n        \"tool_calls\": null\n      },\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"protected_material_code\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": true,\n          \"citation\": {\n            \"URL\": \"https://github.com/SergioSalazarC/CompetitiveProgrammingCodes/tree/298594ba0adf1c4ce6012035c659401d69920a84/problems%2FcodeforcesRound693D%2Fsrc%2FMain.java\",\n            \"license\": \"NOASSERTION\"\n          }\n        },\n        \"protected_material_text\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"created\": 1753310000,\n  \"model\": \"o4-mini-2025-04-16\",\n  \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n  \"service_tier\": null,\n  \"system_fingerprint\": null,\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"completion_tokens\": 22570,\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 899,\n    \"total_tokens\": 23469,\n    \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n      \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"reasoning_tokens\": 18688,\n      \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n    },\n    \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"cached_tokens\": 0\n    }\n  },\n  \"prompt_filter_results\": [\n    {\n      \"prompt_index\": 0,\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"jailbreak\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
