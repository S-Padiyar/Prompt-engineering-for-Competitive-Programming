One of the first programming problems by K1o0n looked like this: "Noobish_Monk has n
 (1≤n≤100)
 friends. Each of them gave him a
 (1≤a≤10000)
 apples for his birthday. Delighted with such a gift, Noobish_Monk returned b
 (1≤b≤min(10000,a⋅n))
 apples to his friends. How many apples are left with Noobish_Monk?"

K1o0n wrote a solution, but accidentally considered the value of n
 as a string, so the value of n⋅a−b
 was calculated differently. Specifically:

when multiplying the string n
 by the integer a
, he will get the string s=n+n+⋯+n+na times
when subtracting the integer b
 from the string s
, the last b
 characters will be removed from it. If b
 is greater than or equal to the length of the string s
, it will become empty.
Learning about this, ErnKor became interested in how many pairs (a,b)
 exist for a given n
, satisfying the constraints of the problem, on which K1o0n's solution gives the correct answer.

"The solution gives the correct answer" means that it outputs a non-empty string, and this string, when converted to an integer, equals the correct answer, i.e., the value of n⋅a−b
.

Input
The first line contains a single integer t
 (1≤t≤100
)  — the number of test cases.

For each test case, a single line of input contains an integer n
 (1≤n≤100
).

It is guaranteed that in all test cases, n
 is distinct.

Output
For each test case, output the answer in the following format:

In the first line, output the integer x
 — the number of bad tests for the given n
.

In the next x
 lines, output two integers ai
 and bi
 — such integers that K1o0n's solution on the test "n
 ai
 bi
" gives the correct answer.
