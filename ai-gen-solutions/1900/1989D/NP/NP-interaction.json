Smithing Skill\n\ntime limit per test3 seconds\n\nmemory limit per test256 megabytes\n\nYou are playing a famous computer game (that just works) where you have various skills you can level up. Today, you focused on the \"Smithing\" skill. Your tactic is obvious: forging weapons from ingots and then melting them back to return the materials partially. For simplicity, every time you create an item, you get 1\n\n experience point, and every time you melt an item, you also get 1\n\n experience point.\n\n\n\nThere are n\n\n classes of weapons you can forge and m\n\n types of metal ingots.\n\n\n\nYou can create one weapon of the i\n\n-th class, spending ai\n\n ingots of metal of the same type. Melting a weapon of the i\n\n-th class (which you crafted earlier) returns you bi\n\n ingots of the type of metal it was made of.\n\n\n\nYou have cj\n\n metal ingots of the j\n\n-th type, and you know that you can craft a weapon of any class from any metal type. Each combination of a weapon class and a metal type can be used any number of times.\n\n\n\nWhat is the maximum total amount of experience you can earn by crafting and melting weapons?\n\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n\n\n and m\n\n (1≤n,m≤106\n\n) — the number of weapon classes and metal types.\n\n\n\nThe second line contains n\n\n integers a1,a2,…,an\n\n (1≤ai≤106\n\n), where ai\n\n is the number of ingots you need to forge one weapon of the i\n\n-th class.\n\n\n\nThe third line contains n\n\n integers b1,b2,…,bn\n\n (0≤bi<ai\n\n), where bi\n\n is the number of ingots you return by melting one weapon of the i\n\n-th class you forged earlier.\n\n\n\nThe fourth line contains m\n\n integers c1,c2,…,cm\n\n (1≤cj≤109\n\n) — the number of ingots you have of the corresponding metal type.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nPrint one integer — the maximum total experience points you can gain by repeatedly forging and melting weapons.\n\n\n\nExamples\n\nInputCopy\n\n5 3\n\n9 6 7 5 5\n\n8 4 5 1 2\n\n10 4 7\n\nOutputCopy\n\n12\n\nInputCopy\n\n3 4\n\n10 20 20\n\n0 0 0\n\n9 10 19 20\n\nOutputCopy\n\n8\n\nInputCopy\n\n1 5\n\n3\n\n1\n\n1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000\n\nOutputCopy\n\n4999999990\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, you can do the following:\n\n\n\ncraft one weapon of the 1\n\n-st class from the 1\n\n-st type of metal, spending 9\n\n ingots;\n\nmelt that weapon, returning 8\n\n ingots of the 1\n\n-st metal type;\n\nagain, craft and melt one weapon of the 1\n\n-st class from the 1\n\n-st metal type;\n\ncraft and melt one weapon of the 3\n\n-rd class from the 1\n\n-st metal type;\n\ncraft and melt one weapon of the 3\n\n-rd class from the 3\n\n-rd metal type;\n\ncraft and melt one weapon of the 4\n\n-th class from the 1\n\n-st metal type;\n\ncraft and melt one weapon of the 5\n\n-th class from the 3\n\n-rd metal type;\n\nIn the end you'll have c=[2,4,2]\n\n ingots left. In total, you've crafted 6\n\n weapons and melted 6\n\n weapons, gaining 12\n\n experience points in total.\n\n---\n\nUse Java."

You can use any class on any pile, and piles do _not_ mix; you must maximize the sum of experience over each pile separately.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Key observations**\\n\\n1.  Since every cycle (forge+ melt) yields exactly 2 XP at net ingot‐cost $d_i$, to maximize XP we want to spend our ingots doing as many of these 2-XP cycles as possible.\\n\\n2.  If we knew that for a particular pile of size $C$ the _best_ class (smallest $d_i$) were available all the way, we would simply do as many full cycles of that single class as we can:\\n   \\\\[\\n     K\\\\;=\\\\;\\\\begin{cases}\\n       0,&C<a_{\\\\min},\\\\\\\\\\n       \\\\displaystyle\\n       \\\\Bigl\\\\lfloor\\\\frac{C-a_{\\\\min}}{d_{\\\\min}}\\\\Bigr\\\\rfloor+1,\\n       &C\\\\ge a_{\\\\min},\\n     \\\\end{cases}\\n   \\\\]\\n   where \\n   \\\\[\\n     d_{\\\\min}=\\\\min_i d_i,\\\\quad\\n     a_{\\\\min}=\\\\min\\\\{a_i\\\\mid a_i - b_i=d_{\\\\min}\\\\}\\n   \\\\]\\n   is the forging‐cost (i.e.\\\\ the $a$) among all classes that tie for minimal net‐cost $d_{\\\\min}$.  After $K$ such cycles, your remaining ingots \\n   \\\\[\\n     C_{\\\\rm rem}=C-K\\\\,d_{\\\\min}\\n   \\\\]\\n   is strictly smaller than $a_{\\\\min}+d_{\\\\min}$.\\n\\n3.  Once the pile has shrunk below $a_{\\\\min}$, you can no longer do any more cycles of the class that had $d_{\\\\min}$.  But you might still do some _other_ classes whose forge‐cost $a_i$ is small enough to fit in your tiny leftover $C_{\\\\rm rem}$.  Notice that\\n   \\\\[\\n     C_{\\\\rm rem}\\\\;<\\\\;a_{\\\\min}+d_{\\\\min}\\n     \\\\;\\\\le\\\\;2\\\\times 10^6\\n   \\\\]\\n   since $a_i\\\\le10^6,\\\\ d_i\\\\le10^6$.  Thus the “tail” problem\\n   \\\\[\\n     \\\\max\\\\;\\\\{\\\\hbox{# of additional cycles}\\\\}\\n     \\\\quad\\\\hbox{starting from at most }2\\\\times10^6\\n   \\\\]\\n   can be precomputed by a small DP.\\n\\n4.  In that leftover‐DP we do exactly the same greedy‐coin idea: at any remainder $R$, pick the class with _smallest_ net‐cost $d_i$ among those whose initial forge‐cost $a_i\\\\le R$, pay that cost $d_i$ and recurse.  One can show that is optimal (since every cycle gives exactly “1 coin” of value and costs $d_i$ coins of weight, and you must meet the one‐time startup constraint $a_i\\\\le R$ to be allowed to use that class).\\n\\nHence the final plan:\\n\\n**Preprocessing**\\n\\n1.  Read all $(a_i,b_i)$, form $d_i=a_i-b_i$.  \\n2.  Build an array `startCost[d] = min\\\\,\\\\{a_i : d_i=d\\\\}`, or =∞ if no class has that $d$.\\n3.  Find the global minimal net cost\\n    ```\\n      Dmin = min{ d : startCost[d] < ∞ }\\n      Amin = startCost[Dmin]\\n    ```\\n4.  Set \\n    ```\\n      A = Amin + Dmin - 1\\n    ```\\n   (this is an upper bound on any leftover $<A$).\\n\\n5.  Gather all pairs `(startCost[d], d)` with `startCost[d] ≤ A`.  \\n   Sort them by `startCost[d]` ascending.  \\n   Now we build an auxiliary array `min_d_for_R[0..A]`:\\n   ```\\n     let p = 0,  best_d = ∞\\n     for R = 0..A:\\n       while p < pairs.size and pairs[p].startCost == R:\\n         best_d = min(best_d, pairs[p].d)\\n         p++\\n       min_d_for_R[R] = best_d   // the cheapest d whose startCost ≤ R\\n   ```\\n\\n6.  Build the DP `dpRem[0..A]`, where\\n   ```\\n     dpRem[0] = 0\\n     for R = 1..A:\\n       if min_d_for_R[R] == ∞:\\n         dpRem[R] = 0\\n       else\\n         dpRem[R] = 1 + dpRem[ R - min_d_for_R[R] ]\\n   ```\\n   so `dpRem[R]` is the max number of _additional_ cycles from a leftover of size $R$.\\n\\n**Answering each pile**\\n\\nFor each pile with $C=c_j$:\\n\\n- If $C < Amin$, we cannot do any cycle of the best class.  We simply take `K_main = 0` and `Rem = C`.\\n- Else we do\\n  ```\\n    K_main = ((C - Amin) / Dmin) + 1\\n    Rem    = C - K_main * Dmin\\n  ```\\n\\n- Then `Rem ≤ A`, so the best we can do with the leftover is `dpRem[Rem]` extra cycles.\\n\\nHence total cycles = `K_main + dpRem[Rem]`, and each cycle gives 2 XP, so\\n```\\n  XP_j = 2 * (K_main + dpRem[Rem])\\n```\\nSum that over all piles to get the final answer.\\n\\nThe overall complexity is  \\n— O(n) to build `startCost[]`,  \\n— O(Dmax) to find Dmin, Amin,  \\n— O(P log P) to sort P≈Dmax pairs,  \\n— O(A + P) to build `min_d_for_R[]`,  \\n— O(A) to build `dpRem[]`,  \\n— O(m) to process all piles.  \\n\\nHere $D_{\\\\max},A\\\\le2\\\\cdot10^6$, $n,m\\\\le10^6$.

Build `startCost[d] = min { a_i : (a_i−b_i)=d }`.  \\n2. Find the _globally cheapest_ cycle‐cost `Dmin = min d` for which `startCost[d]` exists, and let `Amin = startCost[Dmin]`.  \\n3. After doing as many cycles of that class as you can, any pile of size `C` leaves a remainder  \\n   ```\\n     Rem = C − ((C−Amin)/Dmin +1)*Dmin,\\n   ```\\n   which is guaranteed < `Amin + Dmin` (≤2 ×10^6).  \\n4. In that small range `[0..Amin+Dmin−1]` we precompute by a tiny DP how many additional 2-XP cycles we can squeeze out, by always picking the _smallest_ `d` whose forging‐cost `a` fits in the current remainder.  \\n5. Finally we sum up `2*(mainCycles + tailCycles)` over all piles.  \\n\\nThis runs in about O(n + Dmax log Dmax + A + m), comfortably fitting the constraints.\",\n        \"refusal\": null,\n        \"role\": \"assistant\",\n        \"annotations\": [],\n        \"audio\": null,\n        \"function_call\": null,\n        \"tool_calls\": null\n      },\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"protected_material_code\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": true,\n          \"citation\": {\n            \"URL\": \"https://github.com/efgen/solutions-archive/tree/5c02bd6d154e55e0d52d282c089b05913648a025/timus%2F1474.java\",\n            \"license\": \"NOASSERTION\"\n          }\n        },\n        \"protected_material_text\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"created\": 1753309840,\n  \"model\": \"o4-mini-2025-04-16\",\n  \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n  \"service_tier\": null,\n  \"system_fingerprint\": null,\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"completion_tokens\": 13793,\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 778,\n    \"total_tokens\": 14571,\n    \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n      \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"reasoning_tokens\": 11008,\n      \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n    },\n    \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"cached_tokens\": 0\n    }\n  },\n  \"prompt_filter_results\": [\n    {\n      \"prompt_index\": 0,\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"jailbreak\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
