    "content": "**Analysis**\n\nWe want to turn an integer array \\(a\\) of length \\(n\\) into a palindrome (i.e.\\ “beautiful”) under the following rules:\n\n1. **Pre‐shuffling**  \n   Before we do any operations, we are allowed to shuffle the elements of \\(a\\) arbitrarily.\n\n2. **Operation**  \n   We may pick any single index \\(i\\) and replace  \n   \\[\n     a_i \\;\\longleftarrow\\; a_i + k\n   \\]\n   each application of which counts as one operation.\n\n3. **Goal**  \n   After shuffling and these “\\(+k\\)” operations, we want the resulting array \\(b\\) to satisfy\n   \\[\n     b_i = b_{\\,n-i+1}\\quad\n     (1\\le i\\le n).\n   \\]\n   We seek the \\(\\min\\) number of operations needed, or report \\(-1\\) if it cannot be done.\n\n---\n\n### Key observations\n\n1. **Residues mod \\(k\\) must match in each symmetric pair.**  \n   When we add \\(k\\) to a number, its remainder modulo \\(k\\) does *not* change.  Hence, if two numbers are to become equal by only adding multiples of \\(k\\), they must have the same remainder modulo \\(k\\).\n\n2. **Grouping by remainder**  \n   We group all array‐elements \\(a_i\\) according to their residue\n   \\[\n     r = a_i \\bmod k.\n   \\]\n   Within each group (fixed \\(r\\)), every member can only pair up with another member of the *same* group in the final palindrome.\n\n3. **Pairing within a group**  \n   Suppose in one remainder‐class we have elements\n   \\[\n     a_{i_1},a_{i_2},\\dots,a_{i_m},\\quad\n       \\text{all with }a_{i_j}\\bmod k=r.\n   \\]\n   Write\n   \\[\n     a_{i_j} \\;=\\; r + k\\,t_j\n   \\]\n   for integer \\(t_j\\).  Pairing two such elements \\(r + k\\,t_x\\) and \\(r + k\\,t_y\\) into a mirror‐pair requires us to make them both exactly the same final value.  We can only increase, so the cheapest equal‐value they can both reach is\n   \\[\n     r \\;+\\; k\\max(t_x,t_y).\n   \\]\n   The cost in “\\(+k\\)” steps is\n   \\[\n     \\bigl(\\max(t_x,t_y)-t_x\\bigr)\\;+\\;\\bigl(\\max(t_x,t_y)-t_y\\bigr)\n     \\;=\\;\\bigl|t_x-t_y\\bigr|.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Which elements to leave in the center?**  \n   - If \\(n\\) is even, *all* elements must be used up in exact pairs.  Hence *every* remainder‐group must have an even size; otherwise it’s impossible.  \n   - If \\(n\\) is odd, exactly one element remains unpaired in the very middle.  Hence exactly *one* remainder‐group may have odd size, and *all* the others must have even size; otherwise it’s impossible.\n\n5. **Optimal pairing in each group**  \n   Once we fix a group of size \\(m\\) with quotients \\(t_1,t_2,\\dots,t_m\\), we sort those \\(t\\)'s in nondecreasing order.  Then the minimum total of \\(\\sum|t_x-t_y|\\) over disjoint pairings is obtained simply by pairing adjacent elements in the sorted list:\n   \\[\n     (t_1,t_2),\\;(t_3,t_4),\\;\\dots.\n   \\]\n   If the group size \\(m\\) is odd, one element is left unpaired (that will become the center if \\(n\\) is odd).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAlgorithm per test case\n1. Read \\(n,k\\) and the array \\(a\\).\n2. Build a map from remainder \\(r\\in[0,k-1]\\) to a list of quotients \\(t\\,=\\,\\lfloor a_i/k\\rfloor\\).\n3. Count how many remainder‐classes have odd size.\n   - If \\(n\\) is even but there is *any* odd‐sized class, print \\(-1\\).\n   - If \\(n\\) is odd but there is *not exactly one* odd‐sized class, print \\(-1\\).\n4. Otherwise, for each class:\n   - Sort its list of \\(t\\)‐values.\n   - Pair them in adjacent fashion \\((t_1,t_2),(t_3,t_4),\\dots\\) summing \\(\\,(t_2-t_1)+(t_4-t_3)+\\dots\\)\n   - (If the class size is odd, its last element is unpaired and will sit in the midpoint of the palindrome; it contributes zero cost.)\n5. Output the total sum of all pair‐costs.\n\nThis runs in \\(O(n\\log n)\\) per test (sorting each remainder‐class), and the total \\(n\\) across tests is \\(\\le2\\cdot10^5\\), which is efficient in 2s.\n\n---\n\n```java\nimport java.io.*;\nimport java.util.*;\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\n        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));\n        PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(System.out);\n\n        int t = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine());\n        while (t-- > 0) {\n            StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\n            int n = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\n            long k = Long.parseLong(st.nextToken());\n\n            // Read the array\n            st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\n            // Map from remainder r to list of quotients t = floor(a_i/k)\n            HashMap<Long, ArrayList<Long>> groups = new HashMap<>();\n\n            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                long a = Long.parseLong(st.nextToken());\n                long r = a % k;\n                long q = a / k;  // how many times k fits into a\n\n                groups.computeIfAbsent(r, x -> new ArrayList<>()).add(q);\n            }\n\n            // Count how many remainder-classes have odd size\n            int oddCount = 0;\n            for (ArrayList<Long> lst : groups.values()) {\n                if ((lst.size() & 1) == 1) {\n                    oddCount++;\n                }\n            }\n\n            // Check feasibility\n            if ((n % 2 == 0 && oddCount > 0) ||\n                (n % 2 == 1 && oddCount != 1)) {\n                out.println(-1);\n            } else {\n                long answer = 0;\n                // For each class, sort its quotients and sum pairwise diffs\n                for (ArrayList<Long> lst : groups.values()) {\n                    Collections.sort(lst);\n                    for (int i = 0; i + 1 < lst.size(); i += 2) {\n                        answer += lst.get(i + 1) - lst.get(i);\n                    }\n                }\n                out.println(answer);\n            }\n        }\n\n        out.flush();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation of key steps**\n\n- We group by the residue \\(r = a_i \\bmod k\\) because adding \\(k\\) does not change the residue, so only numbers in the *same* residue‐class can ever become equal.\n- Within one residue‐class, each number has the form \\(r + k\\,t\\).  If you take two such numbers \\(r + k\\,t_x\\) and \\(r + k\\,t_y\\), to make them equal by only doing “\\(+k\\)” you must raise the smaller quotient up to the larger,\n  costing \\(\\lvert t_x - t_y\\rvert\\) operations.\n- One final detail is managing the “center” of the palindrome if \\(n\\) is odd: exactly one element can remain unpaired (it sits in the middle).  Hence exactly one residue‐class may have odd size in that case; if \\(n\\) is even, *no* class may have odd size.  Otherwise it is impossible (\\(-1\\)).\n- In each class, once you have a sorted list of quotients, pairing adjacent ones \\((t_1,t_2), (t_3,t_4),\\dots\\) minimizes the sum of absolute differences.\n\nThis solves the problem in \\(O(n\\log n)\\) time per test, which is efficient enough for \\(\\sum n \\le 2\\times 10^5\\)."
