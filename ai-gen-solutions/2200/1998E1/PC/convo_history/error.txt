Malformed secondary AI response for Problem ID 1998E1, round 3:
“Your two‐scenario (‘pure left first’ or ‘pure right first’) check incorrectly excludes valid survivors (e.g. position 4 in the second example). Please derive a correct O(n) or O(n log n) algorithm that handles arbitrary interleavings, and provide one complete Java program in a single code block that reads from stdin and writes the correct f(n) for each test case.”
