F. Firefly's Queries
time limit per test2 seconds
memory limit per test256 megabytes
Firefly is given an array a
 of length n
. Let ci
 denote the i
'th cyclic shift∗
 of a
. She creates a new array b
 such that b=c1+c2+⋯+cn
 where +
 represents concatenation†
.

Then, she asks you q
 queries. For each query, output the sum of all elements in the subarray of b
 that starts from the l
-th element and ends at the r
-th element, inclusive of both ends.

∗
The x
-th (1≤x≤n
) cyclic shift of the array a
 is ax,ax+1…an,a1,a2…ax−1
. Note that the 1
-st shift is the initial a
.

†
The concatenation of two arrays p
 and q
 of length n
 (in other words, p+q
) is p1,p2,...,pn,q1,q2,...,qn
.

Input
The first line contains t
 (1≤t≤104
) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n
 and q
 (1≤n,q≤2⋅105
) — the length of the array and the number of queries.

The following line contains n
 integers a1,a2,...,an
 (1≤ai≤106
).

The following q
 lines contain two integers l
 and r
 (1≤l≤r≤n2
) — the left and right bounds of the query.

Note that the large inputs may require the use of 64-bit integers.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n
 does not exceed 2⋅105
 and the sum of q
 does not exceed 2⋅105
.

Output
For each query, output the answer on a new line.
