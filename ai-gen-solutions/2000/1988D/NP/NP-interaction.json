The Omnipotent Monster Killer\n\ntime limit per test3 seconds\n\nmemory limit per test512 megabytes\n\nYou, the monster killer, want to kill a group of monsters. The monsters are on a tree with n\n\n vertices. On vertex with number i\n\n (1≤i≤n\n\n), there is a monster with ai\n\n attack points. You want to battle with monsters for 10100\n\n rounds.\n\n\n\nIn each round, the following happens in order:\n\n\n\nAll living monsters attack you. Your health decreases by the sum of attack points of all living monsters.\n\nYou select some (possibly all or none) monsters and kill them. After being killed, the monster will not be able to do any attacks in the future.\n\nThere is a restriction: in one round, you cannot kill two monsters that are directly connected by an edge.\n\n\n\nIf you choose what monsters to attack optimally, what is the smallest health decrement you can have after all rounds?\n\n\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t\n\n (1≤t≤104\n\n). Description of the test cases follows.\n\n\n\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer n\n\n (1≤n≤3⋅105\n\n).\n\n\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n\n\n integers a1,…,an\n\n (1≤ai≤1012\n\n).\n\n\n\nThe following n−1\n\n lines each contain two integers x,y\n\n (1≤x,y≤n\n\n), denoting an edge on the tree connecting vertex x\n\n and y\n\n.\n\n\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n\n\n over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅105\n\n.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print one integer: the minimum possible health decrement.\n\n\n\nExample\n\nInputCopy\n\n3\n\n1\n\n1000000000000\n\n5\n\n47 15 32 29 23\n\n1 2\n\n1 3\n\n2 4\n\n2 5\n\n7\n\n8 10 2 3 5 7 4\n\n1 2\n\n1 4\n\n3 2\n\n5 3\n\n6 2\n\n7 5\n\nOutputCopy\n\n1000000000000\n\n193\n\n57\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, an optimal sequence of operations would be:\n\n\n\nIn the first round: first, receive the attack from the monster on vertex 1\n\n, so your health decreases by 1012\n\n.

Then kill the monsters on vertex 1,4,5\n\n.\n\nIn the second round: first, receive the attack from the monster on vertex 2,3\n\n, so your health decreases by 15+32=47\n\n. Then kill the monsters on vertex 2,3\n\n.\n\nIn the third round to the 10100\n\n-th round: all monsters have been killed, so nothing happens.\n\nThe total health decrement is 193\n\n.\n\n\n\nIn the third test case, an optimal sequence of operations would be:\n\n\n\nIn the first round: first, receive the attack from the monster on vertex 1,2,3,4,5,6,7\n\n, so your health decreases by 8+10+2+3+5+7+4=39\n\n. Then kill the monsters on vertex 1,3,6,7\n\n.\n\nIn the second round: first, receive the attack from the monster on vertex 2,4,5\n\n, so your health decreases by 10+3+5=18\n\n. Then kill the monsters on vertex 2,4,5\n\n.\n\nIn the third round to the 10100\n\n-th round: all monsters have been killed, so nothing happens.\n\nThe total health decrement is 57\n\n.\n\n---\n\nUse Java."

If we **only** use rounds 1 and 2, we have exactly two valid ways to kill:\\n\\n- Kill all color-0 vertices in round 1, and all color-1 vertices in round 2.\\n- Kill all color-1 vertices in round 1, and all color-0 vertices in round 2.\\n\\nIn the first scenario the total damage is\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i\\n\\\\;+\\\\;\\\\sum_{\\\\substack{i\\\\colon\\\\text{color}(i)=1}} a_i\\n\\\\;=\\\\;\\\\bigl(\\\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i\\\\bigr)\\\\;+\\\\;S_1,\\n\\\\]\\nwhere \\\\(S_1\\\\) is the sum of \\\\(a_i\\\\) over the color-1 part.  In the second scenario we get\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i + S_0,\\n\\\\]\\nwhere \\\\(S_0\\\\) is the sum over the color-0 part.  We pick the smaller of the two, namely\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i \\\\;+\\\\;\\\\min\\\\{S_0,S_1\\\\}.\\n\\\\]\\n\\nOne shows (by a simple parity‐compression or exchange argument) that no scheme using more than two rounds can do better than this 2‐color solution.
