You may want to read both versions. You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.\n\n\n\nYou are given an array a\n\n of length n\n\n. Start with c=0\n\n. Then, for each i\n\n from 1\n\n to n\n\n (in increasing order) do exactly one of the following:\n\n\n\nOption 1\n\n: set c\n\n to c+ai\n\n.\n\nOption 2\n\n: set c\n\n to |c+ai|\n\n, where |x|\n\n is the absolute value of x\n\n.\n\nLet the maximum final value of c\n\n after the procedure described above be equal to k\n\n. Find the number of unique procedures that result in c=k\n\n. Two procedures are different if at any index i\n\n, one procedure chose option 1\n\n and another chose option 2\n\n, even if the value of c\n\n is equal for both procedures after that turn.\n\n\n\nSince the answer may be large, output it modulo 998244353\n\n.\n\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t\n\n (1≤t≤104\n\n) — the number of test cases.\n\n\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer n\n\n (2≤n≤2⋅105\n\n).\n\n\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n\n\n integers a1,a2,…,an\n\n (−109≤ai≤109\n\n).\n\n\n\nThe sum of n\n\n over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅105\n\n.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single integer — the number of unique procedures that result in c=k\n\n, modulo 998244353\n\n.\n\n\n\nExample\n\nInputCopy\n\n5\n\n4\n\n2 -5 3 -3\n\n8\n\n1 4 3 4 1 4 3 4\n\n3\n\n-1 -2 -3\n\n4\n\n-1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000\n\n4\n\n1 9 8 4\n\nOutputCopy\n\n12\n\n256\n\n1\n\n8\n\n16\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, it can be shown that our maximal final value of c\n\n is 3\n\n. There are 12\n\n ways to achieve this because in order to get 3\n\n, we have to take absolute value at indices 2\n\n or 4\n\n, or both, resulting in 3\n\n ways. For the other two indices, it doesn't change the value whether we take absolute value or not, so we have 2⋅2=4\n\n ways for them. In total, we have 3⋅4=12\n\n ways.\n\n\n\nIn the second test case, taking the absolute value will never change anything, so we can either take absolute value or not, for every index. This gives us 28=256\n\n possible ways.\n\nUse Java."
