**Analysis**

We have \(n\) different kinds of flowers.  The \(i\)-th kind has
- \(a_i\) petals per flower (all \(a_i\) are distinct),  
- \(c_i\) flowers available,  
- each flower of that kind costs exactly \(a_i\) coins.

We have \(m\) coins total.  We want to pick a multiset of flowers whose total cost does not exceed \(m\), and which maximizes the total number of petals, under the **additional constraint** that among all chosen flowers the maximum petal‐count differs from the minimum petal‐count by at most 1.  In other words, if we pick any petals \(x\) and \(y\), then \(|x-y|\le1\).

Since all \(a_i\) are distinct integers, any valid bouquet can only use flowers of
- a single petal‐count \(v\), or  
- two adjacent petal‐counts \(v\) and \(v+1\).  

We simply try every such “window” in the sorted list of \((a_i,c_i)\).

1.  Sort \((a_i,c_i)\) by \(a_i\).  
2.  For each index \(i\), let \((v,c_0)=(a_i,c_i)\).  
   -  First consider using only petal‐count \(v\).  We can afford at most \(\lfloor m/v\rfloor\) flowers of cost \(v\), but at most \(c_0\) are in stock, so we take 
      \[
        x \;=\;\min\bigl(c_0,\;\lfloor m/v\rfloor\bigr),\quad
        \text{petals} \;=\; x\,v.
      \]
   -  Then, if the next type is exactly \(v+1\), say it has \((v+1,c_1)\), we solve the 2‐type knapsack with  
     \[
       \text{weight}(v)=v,\quad 
       \text{weight}(v+1)=v+1,
     \]
     each with their stock limits \(c_0,c_1\), budget \(m\), and profit=weight.  
     
     Although a full knapsack might suggest complexity, with only two types one can do an \(O(1)\) split into “take as many \((v+1)\)-flowers as makes sense up to some boundary, then fill with \(v\)-flowers, or vice versa,” plus a tiny residue‐adjustment (at most one modulo‐class scan of size \(\le v\)).  This stays \(O(1)\) per adjacent pair.

The total cost of all tests is \(n\log n\) (for the sorts) plus \(O(n)\) for the two‐type scans overall, which is fine up to \(n=2\cdot10^5\).

**Explanation of key steps**

1.  **Sorting.**  We sort all flower‐types by their petal‐count `a[i]`.  
2.  **Single‐type take.**  For each kind \(v\) we can afford up to \(\lfloor m/v\rfloor\) flowers by budget, but there are only `c[i]` in stock, so we take
    \[
      x = \min\bigl(\,c[i],\,\lfloor m/v\rfloor\bigr),
      \quad\text{petals} = x\cdot v.
    \]
3.  **Two adjacent petal‐counts \((v,v+1)\).**  
    -  Let `cnt0` = stock of \(v\), `cnt1` = stock of \(v+1\).  
    -  We cannot take more than \(\lfloor m/(v+1)\rfloor\) of \((v+1)\)-flowers, denote that upper bound `Y_hi`.  
    -  We split the \((y\)-range) into two regions:
       1.  **Region 1:**  We first “fill” all cheap \(v\)-flowers if possible, then add \((v+1)\)-flowers up to budget.  One solves \((m-y\,(v+1))\ge v\cdot \text{cnt0}\) for \(y\), getting a boundary \(y_1\).  For \(0\le y\le y_1\) we have enough cheap ones to spend the rest of the money → exact formula.  
       2.  **Region 2:**  For \(y>y_1\), we run out of cheaps and do an “expensive first, then cheap” with a small residue fit.  One wants to maximize
          \[
            f(y) \;=\; y\,\bigl(v+1\bigr)\;+\;v \cdot
               \min\Bigl(\text{cnt0},\,\lfloor\bigl(m - y\,(v+1)\bigr)/v\rfloor\Bigr).
          \]
          A modular‐arithmetic trick shows it suffices to scan at most \(\min(v,\text{length of }y)\) residue‐classes in \(O(1)\).  In practice we detect either we cover a full residue class (so we can hit total \(=m\) exactly) or we only cover an interval of residues, from which the minimal leftover \((m-y\,(v+1))\bmod v\) can be found by a constant‐time “two‐endpoints on a circle” check.
    -  We also explicitly check the pure “take as many expensive \((v+1)\) as you can, then fill cheaply” corner.
4.  We take the maximum among all those candidates.

This runs in \(O(n\log n + n)\) time and easily handles up to \(2\times10^5\) total flower‐types.
