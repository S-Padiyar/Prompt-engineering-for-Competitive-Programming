Each vertex has a value of 0\n\n or 1\n\n.\n\n\n\nLet's consider a leaf of the tree (the vertex 1\n\n is never considered a leaf) and define its weight. Construct a string formed by the values of the vertices on the path starting at the root and ending in this leaf. Then the weight of the leaf is the difference between the number of occurrences of 10\n\n and 01\n\n substrings in it.\n\n\n\nTake the following tree as an example. Green vertices have a value of 1\n\n while white vertices have a value of 0\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's calculate the weight of the leaf 5\n\n: the formed string is 10110\n\n. The number of occurrences of substring 10\n\n is 2\n\n, the number of occurrences of substring 01\n\n is 1\n\n, so the difference is 2−1=1\n\n.\n\nLet's calculate the weight of the leaf 6\n\n: the formed string is 101\n\n. The number of occurrences of substring 10\n\n is 1\n\n, the number of occurrences of substring 01\n\n is 1\n\n, so the difference is 1−1=0\n\n.\n\nThe score of a tree is defined as the number of leaves with non-zero weight in the tree.\n\n\n\nBut the values of some vertices haven't been decided and will be given to you as ?\n\n. Filling the blanks would be so boring, so Iris is going to invite Dora to play a game. On each turn, one of the girls chooses any of the remaining vertices with value ?\n\n and changes its value to 0\n\n or 1\n\n, with Iris going first. The game continues until there are no vertices with value ?\n\n left in the tree. Iris aims to maximize the score of the tree, while Dora aims to minimize that.\n\n\n\nAssuming that both girls play optimally, please determine the final score of the tree.\n\n\n\nInput\n\nEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t\n\n (1≤t≤5⋅104\n\n) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.\n\n\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer n\n\n (2≤n≤105\n\n) — the number of vertices in the tree.\n\n\n\nThe following n−1\n\n lines each contain two integers u\n\n and v\n\n (1≤u,v≤n\n\n) — denoting an edge between vertices u\n\n and v\n\n.\n\n\n\nIt's guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.\n\n\n\nThe last line contains a string s\n\n of length n\n\n. The i\n\n-th character of s\n\n represents the value of vertex i\n\n. It's guaranteed that s\n\n only contains characters 0\n\n, 1\n\n and ?\n\n.\n\n\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n\n\n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2⋅105\n\n.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single integer — the final score of the tree.\n\n\n\nExample\n\nInputCopy\n\n6\n\n4\n\n1 2\n\n1 3\n\n4 1\n\n0101\n\n4\n\n1 2\n\n3 2\n\n2 4\n\n???0\n\n5\n\n1 2\n\n1 3\n\n2 4\n\n2 5\n\n?1?01\n\n6\n\n1 2\n\n2 3\n\n3 4\n\n5 3\n\n3 6\n\n?0????\n\n5\n\n1 2\n\n1 3\n\n1 4\n\n1 5\n\n11?1?\n\n2\n\n2 1\n\n??\n\nOutputCopy\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, all the values of the vertices have been determined. There are three different paths from the root to a leaf:\n\n\n\nFrom vertex 1\n\n to vertex 2\n\n. The string formed by the path is 01\n\n, so the weight of the leaf is 0−1=−1\n\n.\n\nFrom vertex 1\n\n to vertex 3\n\n. The string formed by the path is 00\n\n, so the weight of the leaf is 0−0=0\n\n.\n\nFrom vertex 1\n\n to vertex 4\n\n. The string formed by the path is 01\n\n, so the weight of the leaf is 0−1=−1\n\n.\n\nThus, there are two leaves with non-zero weight, so the score of the tree is 2\n\n.\n\n\n\nIn the second test case, one of the sequences of optimal choices for the two players can be:\n\n\n\nIris chooses to change the value of the vertex 3\n\n to 1\n\n.\n\nDora chooses to change the value of the vertex 1\n\n to 0\n\n.\n\nIris chooses to change the value of the vertex 2\n\n to 0\n\n.\n\nThe final tree is as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe only leaf with non-zero weight is 3\n\n, so the score of the tree is 1\n\n. Note that this may not be the only sequence of optimal choices for Iris and Dora.\n\n---\n\nYou are a competitive programming assistant solving Codeforces problems using Java. First, carefully read and restate the problem in your own words to ensure full understanding. Identify the input and output formats, list the constraints, and consider any edge cases that might affect the logic. Next, determine which algorithmic pattern the problem fits best—such as greedy, binary search, two pointers, dynamic programming, or graph traversal—and briefly explain why that pattern applies. Then, plan your solution step by step, describing the key ideas, data structures, or mathematical insights you’ll use. Once your plan is clear, write a clean and fully working Java program. Use import java.util.*; and include a Main class with a main method, using Scanner or BufferedReader for input depending on the constraints. Add comments to explain important logic in the code. After coding, walk through a sample input manually to show how your solution works in practice. Finally, analyze the time and space complexity of your approach using Big-O notation, justifying your answer. Think step by step and only write code once the logic is sound and complete."

Each vertex has a symbol in {0,1,?}.  A **leaf** is any vertex ≠ 1 of degree 1.  We form the value‐string on the path from root to each leaf; we count\\n\\n weight(leaf) = (# of “10” substrings) − (# of “01” substrings)\\n\\nA short (and well‐known) fact about any 0/1‐string \\\\(s\\\\) is\\n\\n (#“10”) − (#“01”) \\\\;=\\\\; s[1] − s[n]\\n\\nwhere we interpret ‘0’→0, ‘1’→1.  In our tree, \\\\(s[1]\\\\) is the root’s bit and \\\\(s[n]\\\\) is the leaf’s bit.  Hence\\n\\n weight(leaf) ≠ 0\\n ⇔ s(root) ≠ s(leaf).\\n\\nSo the *score* of the final full assignment is simply the number of leaves whose final bit differs from the root’s final bit.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**The two‐player game**\\n\\n- Iris and Dora alternate turning a ‘?’ into either ‘0’ or ‘1’, Iris goes first.\\n- Iris tries to **maximize** the final score; Dora tries to **minimize** it.\\n- Once all ‘?’’s are gone, we look at how many leaves “mismatch” the root.\\n\\nCall\\n\\n • \\\\(L_0\\\\) = # of leaves already fixed to ‘0’.  \\n • \\\\(L_1\\\\) = # of leaves already fixed to ‘1’.  \\n • \\\\(U\\\\)   = # of leaves whose label is ‘?’.  \\n • \\\\(m\\\\)   = # of internal vertices (not root, not leaf) whose label is ‘?’.  \\n\\nFinally the root itself may be ‘0’, ‘1’, or ‘?’.\\n\\nWe show that **only** the root and the leaves ever *really* affect the score.  Interior–‘?’ serve only as “dummy moves” that can be used to shift who gets to choose the root or who gets the first leaf‐assignment.\\n\\nWe split into two main cases:\\n\\n1.  **Root is already fixed** to 0 or 1.\\n    \\n    Then we never touch the root.  The only important moves are the \\\\(U\\\\) leaves.  \\n    - If no interior–‘?’ (i.e.\\\\ \\\\(m=0\\\\)), Iris moves first on the leaves, so she gets \\\\(\\\\lceil U/2\\\\rceil\\\\) of them; Dora gets the other \\\\(\\\\lfloor U/2\\\\rfloor\\\\).  \\n    - If \\\\(m>0\\\\), Iris could waste a first move on an internal ‘?’ to try to force Dora to move first on leaves.  But in fact Dora never wants to *waste* a move on a dummy when she can set a leaf to match the root.  One checks that the optimum is still Iris → leaves first → so Iris always gets \\\\(\\\\lceil U/2\\\\rceil\\\\).  \\n\\n    Thus if the root is fixed to \\\\(r\\\\in\\\\{0,1\\\\}\\\\), the final score is\\n\\n      base  \\n      = number of *already* mismatched leaves  \\n      = \\\\(\\\\bigl(r=0?\\\\;L_1\\\\;:\\\\;L_0\\\\bigr)\\\\)  \\n\\n    plus the contributions from the \\\\(U\\\\) leaves that Iris will secure, namely \\\\(\\\\lceil U/2\\\\rceil\\\\).\\n\\n2.  **Root is ‘?’**  \\n    Now Iris can choose whether to assign the root **herself** right away (move 1), or waste move 1 on an internal ‘?’ to force Dora to assign the root (move 2).  \\n   \\n    - **Option A**: Iris sets the root at move 1 to the value \\\\(r\\\\) that *maximizes*  \\n      \\n          base(r) + floor(U/2)\\n      \\n      where \\\\( \\\\mathrm{base}(r)= (r=0?L_1:L_0)\\\\), and then Dora moves first among the leaves, so Iris only gets \\\\(\\\\lfloor U/2\\\\rfloor\\\\) of them.\\n      \\n      Hence  \\n         \\\\(V_1=\\\\max\\\\bigl(L_1,L_0\\\\bigr)\\\\;+\\\\;\\\\lfloor U/2\\\\rfloor.\\\\)\\n      \\n    - **Option B**: Iris wastes her first move on an *internal* ‘?’, forcing Dora to assign the root at move 2.  Dora will choose \\\\(r\\\\) to *minimize*  \\n      \\n          base(r) + ceil(U/2)\\n      \\n      and then Iris starts among the leaves, so she secures \\\\(\\\\lceil U/2\\\\rceil\\\\).  \\n\\n      Hence  \\n         \\\\(V_2=\\\\min\\\\bigl(L_1,L_0\\\\bigr)\\\\;+\\\\;\\\\lceil U/2\\\\rceil,\\\\)\\n      \\n    but **Option B** is only available if there *is* at least one internal ‘?’ (i.e.\\\\ \\\\(m>0\\\\)).\\n\\nFinally, when the root is ‘?’ we take\\n\\n   If \\\\(m=0\\\\):  answer = \\\\(V_1\\\\).  \\n   Otherwise:   answer = \\\\(\\\\max(V_1,V_2)\\\\).\\n\\nPutting everything together gives an \\\\(O(n)\\\\) pass per tree:\\n\\n1.  Read the tree, find the leaves (degree 1, excluding node 1).\\n2.  Tally \\\\(L_0,L_1,U\\\\) from the leaves; tally \\\\(m\\\\) over interior ‘?’.\\n3.
