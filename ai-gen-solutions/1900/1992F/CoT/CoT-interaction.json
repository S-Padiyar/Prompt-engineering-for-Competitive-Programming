Valuable Cards\n\ntime limit per test4 seconds\n\nmemory limit per test512 megabytes\n\nIn his favorite cafe Kmes once again wanted to try the herring under a fur coat. Previously, it would not have been difficult for him to do this, but the cafe recently introduced a new purchasing policy.\n\n\n\nNow, in order to make a purchase, Kmes needs to solve the following problem: n\n\n cards with prices for different positions are laid out in front of him, on the i\n\n-th card there is an integer ai\n\n, among these prices there is no whole positive integer x\n\n.\n\n\n\nKmes is asked to divide these cards into the minimum number of bad segments (so that each card belongs to exactly one segment). A segment is considered bad if it is impossible to select a subset of cards with a product equal to x\n\n. All segments, in which Kmes will divide the cards, must be bad.\n\n\n\nFormally, the segment (l,r)\n\n is bad if there are no indices i1<i2<…<ik\n\n such that l≤i1,ik≤r\n\n, and ai1⋅ai2…⋅aik=x\n\n.\n\n\n\nHelp Kmes determine the minimum number of bad segments in order to enjoy his favorite dish.\n\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t\n\n (1≤t≤103\n\n) — the number of test cases.\n\n\n\nThe first line of each set of input data gives you 2\n\n integers n\n\n and x\n\n (1≤n≤105,2≤x≤105\n\n) — the number of cards and the integer, respectively.\n\n\n\nThe second line of each set of input data contains n\n\n integers ai\n\n (1≤ai≤2⋅105,ai≠x\n\n) — the prices on the cards.\n\n\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n\n\n over all sets of test data does not exceed 105\n\n.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each set of input data, output the minimum number of bad segments.\n\n\n\nExample\n\nInputCopy\n\n8\n\n6 4\n\n2 3 6 2 1 2\n\n9 100000\n\n50000 25000 12500 6250 3125 2 4 8 16\n\n5 2\n\n1 1 1 1 1\n\n8 6\n\n4 3 4 3 4 3 4 3\n\n7 12\n\n6 11 1 3 11 10 2\n\n10 5\n\n2 4 4 2 4 4 4 3 1 1\n\n7 8\n\n4 6 5 1 2 4 1\n\n8 27\n\n3 9 17 26 2 20 9 3\n\nOutputCopy\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n1\n\n3\n\n3\n\n---\n\nLet's think step-by-step so we don't make mistakes.

It is guaranteed that no single card equals _x_ (so aᵢ ≠ _x_ for all _i_).  We wish to partition the array into the minimum number of contiguous **bad** segments, where a segment is called **bad** if **no** subset (not necessarily contiguous) of its cards has product exactly _x_.  \\n\\nEquivalently, we scan from left to right, maintaining a sliding‐window segment that is still **bad**; as soon as adding a new card would allow some subset of the window to multiply to _x_, we must cut the segment right before that card.  We then start a new segment at that card, and continue.\\n\\nTo check quickly whether a growing segment has some subset with product _x_, note that _x_ ≤ 10⁵ has at most about 128 divisors.  Let\\n\\n  \\tdiv₀ = 1, div₁, div₂, …, div_{D–1} = _x_\\n\\nbe the sorted list of all divisors of _x_.  We keep a boolean DP array\\n\\n  \\tdp[j] = “can we select some subset of the current segment whose product is div_j?”\\n\\nInitially (empty segment) dp[0] = true (product 1 is always possible), others false.  When we add a new card aᵢ that divides _x_, we update\\n\\n  for j = D–1 down to 0:\\n   if dp[j] is true and div_j·aᵢ ≤ _x_, \\n   let newVal = div_j·aᵢ, and find its index `k = idx[newVal]`.  \\n   set dp[k] = true.\\n\\nIf after that `dp[idx[x]]` becomes true, then the segment is no longer bad (it is “good”), so we must cut **before** aᵢ.  We increment our segment‐count, reset dp to all false except dp[0]=true, and **replay** the update for aᵢ in the fresh segment (which never yields dp[x] because aᵢ ≠ x).  This greedy—always extend until you first must cut—produces the minimum number of bad segments.\\n\\nEach test requires:\\n\\n1. Factor _x_ in O(√x), gather its divisors, sort them (at most ≈128).\\n2. Build an array `idx[divisor] = position` so each divisor maps to its 0‐based index.\\n3. Scan the _n_ cards with an O(D) DP‐update per card, plus O(D) per cut.  Summed over all tests, _n_ ≤ 10⁵, D ≤ ~128, so about 2·10⁷ steps—easily within 4s in Java.\\n\\nBelow is a clean Java implementation.\\n\\n```java\\nimport java.io.*;\\nimport java.util.*;\\n\\npublic class Main {\\n    static final int MAXX = 100000;\\n    // divIdx[v] = (1 + index of v in the divisor list), or 0 if v is not a divisor\\n    static int[] divIdx = new int[MAXX + 1];\\n\\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\\n        FastReader in = new FastReader();\\n        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\\n\\n        int t = in.nextInt();\\n        while (t-- > 0) {\\n            int n = in.nextInt();\\n            int x = in.nextInt();\\n            int[] a = new int[n];\\n            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\\n                a[i] = in.nextInt();\\n            }\\n\\n            // 1) Compute and sort all divisors of x\\n            List<Integer> divsList = new ArrayList<>();\\n            for (int d = 1; d * d <= x; d++) {\\n                if (x % d == 0) {\\n                    divsList.add(d);\\n                    if (d * d != x) {\\n                        divsList.add(x / d);\\n                    }\\n                }\\n            }\\n            Collections.sort(divsList);\\n            int D = divsList.size();\\n            int[] divs = new int[D];\\n            for (int i = 0; i < D; i++) {\\n                divs[i] = divsList.get(i);\\n                // mark in divIdx so we can map a divisor back to its index\\n                divIdx[divs[i]] = i + 1;\\n            }\\n            int xIdx = divIdx[x] - 1;  // index of x among divisors\\n\\n            // 2) We'll maintain a DP array dp[j] = can we form divisor divs[j] in current segment\\n            boolean[] dp = new boolean[D];\\n            dp[0] = true;  // we can always form product 1 (divs[0] == 1)\\n\\n            int segments = 1;  // at least one segment\\n            for (int v : a) {\\n                // If v doesn't divide x, it can't help form x, so skip it\\n                if (x % v != 0) continue;\\n\\n                int vmax = x / v;  // to avoid overflow, only divs[j] <= x/v can multiply by v\\n                boolean cut = false;\\n\\n                // Try to add v to current segment's DP\\n                for (int j = D - 1; j >= 0; j--) {\\n                    if (!dp[j]) continue;\\n                    int dj = divs[j];\\n                    if (dj > vmax) continue;\\n                    int prod = dj * v;      // guaranteed ≤ x\\n                    int k = divIdx[prod] - 1; \\n                    if (!dp[k]) {\\n                        dp[k] = true;\\n                    }\\n                    // If we just made dp[x] = true, we must cut\\n                    if (k == xIdx) {\\n                        cut = true;\\n                    }\\n                }\\n\\n                if (cut) {\\n                    // start a new segment at v\\n                    segments++;\\n                    Arrays.fill(dp, false);\\n                    dp[0] = true;\\n                    // replay v into the fresh dp\\n                    for (int j = D - 1; j >= 0; j--) {\\n                        if (!dp[j]) continue;\\n                        int dj = divs[j];\\n                        if (dj > vmax) continue;\\n                        int prod = dj * v;\\n                        int k = divIdx[prod] - 1;\\n                        dp[k] = true;\\n                    }\\n                }\\n            }\\n\\n            // Clear divIdx entries for the next test\\n            for (int d : divs) {\\n                divIdx[d] = 0;\\n            }\\n\\n            sb.append(segments).append('\\\\n');\\n        }\\n\\n        System.out.print(sb);\\n    }\\n\\n    // Fast IO\\n    static class FastReader {\\n        BufferedReader br;\\n        StringTokenizer st;\\n        FastReader() {\\n            br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));\\n        }\\n        String next() throws IOException {\\n            while (st == null || !st.hasMoreTokens())\\n                st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\\n            return st.nextToken();\\n        }\\n        int nextInt() throws IOException {\\n            return Integer.parseInt(next());\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Explanation of Key Steps**\\n\\n1. **Divisors Preprocessing**  \\n   We factor _x_ in O(√x), collect its divisors (at most ~128), sort them, and build a tiny array‐map `divIdx[divisor] → its 0-based index`.  \\n2. **Subset‐Product DP**  \\n   We keep a boolean array `dp[j]` saying “we can pick some subset of the current window whose product is exactly `divs[j]`.”  Initially only `dp[0] = true` (product 1).  \\n   To add a new card _v_ that divides _x_, we do a **backward** scan j = D-1 … 0 and if `dp[j]` was true, we turn on  \\n     dp[`index_of(divs[j]*v)`] = true  \\n   provided `divs[j]*v` ≤ _x_.  If we ever set dp at the index of _x_, the segment can now form _x_ ⇒ it is **good**, so we must cut before this card.  \\n3. **Greedy Cutting**  \\n   As soon as the DP “becomes good” (can form _x_), we finalize the previous segment, reset `dp[]`, and replay the current card into the new segment.  This ensures every segment is **bad**, and greedily makes them as long as possible, yielding the **minimum** number of bad segments.  \\n\\nThis runs in O((_n_ + number_of_divisors(_x_)) · number_of_divisors(_x_)) per test, comfortably fast for ∑_n_ ≤ 10⁵ and up to 10³ tests.\",\n        \"refusal\": null,\n        \"role\": \"assistant\",\n        \"annotations\": [],\n        \"audio\": null,\n        \"function_call\": null,\n        \"tool_calls\": null\n      },\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"protected_material_code\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": true,\n          \"citation\": {\n            \"URL\": \"https://github.com/sunnynikhil/Javacourse/tree/3da222d73b62a89cf3294f6d581eb46f3053fe5a/firstandlastoccurances.java\",\n            \"license\": \"NOASSERTION\"\n          }\n        },\n        \"protected_material_text\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"created\": 1753309803,\n  \"model\": \"o4-mini-2025-04-16\",\n  \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n  \"service_tier\": null,\n  \"system_fingerprint\": null,\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"completion_tokens\": 11669,\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 621,\n    \"total_tokens\": 12290,\n    \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n      \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"reasoning_tokens\": 9728,\n      \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n    },\n    \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"cached_tokens\": 0\n    }\n  },\n  \"prompt_filter_results\": [\n    {\n      \"prompt_index\": 0,\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"jailbreak\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
