First, carefully read and restate the problem in your own words to ensure full understanding. Identify the input and output formats, list the constraints, and consider any edge cases that might affect the logic. Next, determine which algorithmic pattern the problem fits best—such as greedy, binary search, two pointers, dynamic programming, or graph traversal—and briefly explain why that pattern applies. Then, plan your solution step by step, describing the key ideas, data structures, or mathematical insights you’ll use. Once your plan is clear, write a clean and fully working Java program. Use import java.util.*; and include a Main class with a main method, using Scanner or BufferedReader for input depending on the constraints. Add comments to explain important logic in the code. After coding, walk through a sample input manually to show how your solution works in practice. Finally, analyze the time and space complexity of your approach using Big-O notation, justifying your answer. Think step by step and only write code once the logic is sound and complete."

We may perform up to k unit‐increment operations, each of which picks an index i with b[i]=1 and does a[i]++.  After all operations, we define our **score** to be\\n\\n \\\\displaystyle \\\\max_{1\\\\le i\\\\le n}\\\\bigl\\\\{\\\\,a'[i]\\\\;+\\\\;\\\\mathrm{median}(a'\\\\setminus\\\\{a'[i]\\\\})\\\\bigr\\\\}\\\\,,\\n\\nwhere a′ is the final array and “median” of a length‐(n−1) array c is the \\\\(\\\\bigl\\\\lfloor\\\\frac{(n-1)+2}2\\\\bigr\\\\rfloor\\\\)-th smallest element of c.\\n\\nWe want to choose where to spend at most k increments (only on positions with b[i]=1) so as to **maximize** that final score.\\n\\nKey insights:\\n\\n1.  If we pick index i as our “champion,” the score contributed by i is  \\n   \\n   \\\\[\\n     \\\\text{(final)}\\\\,a'[i]\\\\;+\\\\;m_i\\n   \\\\]\\n   \\n   where m_i = median of all the other n−1 entries after increments.  \\n   \\n2.  Incrementing the champion itself by 1 costs 1 operation and raises the champion’s term by exactly 1.  \\n3.  Raising the median m_i by 1 generally costs at least F = ⌊n/2⌋ operations, because to make the (⌊(n−1)+2⌋/2)-th‐smallest element go up by 1, you must bring up at least F elements that were “just below” the median.  \\n\\n   Hence we have a **trade‐off**:  \\n   \\n   - Spending 1 op on the champion gives +1 to the champion term.  \\n   - Spending 1 op toward the median typically gives ≪1 to the final score (it takes ~F ops to raise the median by 1).  \\n\\n4.  In practice the best split of the k operations is **either**:  \\n   \\n   a) **All** on the champion (if b[i]=1), or  \\n   b) **All** on the median‐group.  \\n   \\n   Trying to split in‐between never beats “all” or “none” because the median‐cost function is convex: once you devote ops to median, you do so in big chunks of size ~F per +1 median.\\n\\n5.  Therefore for any candidate champion index i we only need to test two scenarios:\\n\\n   **(A)**  Spend **0** ops on the champion and use up to k ops on the median.  Then the champion value is fixed at a[i], and we ask: can we make the median m_i ≥ (S−a[i]) with ≤k ops?  \\n\\n   **(B)**  Spend **all** k ops on the champion (only possible if b[i]=1), boosting a[i] to a[i]+k, and spend 0 on the median.  Then the median stays at its initial value m_i^0, and the score for i is (a[i]+k)+m_i^0.  \\n\\nWe binary‐search the final answer S.  For each S we check feasibility in O(n log n):\\n\\n  1.  **Precompute** initial medians m_i^0 for each i (this only depends on the initial sorted order of (a[i], b[i])).  In fact after sorting by a[i] we know that removing one index either leaves the “lower” median M_t or the “upper” median M_{t+1}, with t=⌊(n+1)/2⌋.  \\n  2.  **Scenario B** is easy to test: if for some i with b[i]=1 we have  \\n         a[i] + k + m_i^0 ≥ S  \\n     then S is feasible.  \\n  3.  **Scenario A**: we want a[i] + (new median m_i) ≥ S, but we set a[i] unchanged, so m_i ≥ S−a[i].  To test whether we can raise the median among the **other** n−1 elements up to Y=S−a[i] using ≤k ops, we do this:\\n     \\n     –  Build an array of “median‐costs” for each j ≠ i:\\n        cost_j = max(0, Y − a[j])  if b[j]=1,  \\n                 = +∞ if b[j]=0 and a[j]<Y,  \\n                 = 0 if a[j]≥Y.  \\n     –  We pick the F = ⌊n/2⌋ smallest costs among those n−1 entries, sum them up; if that sum ≤ k, we can push up the median to ≥Y.  \\n     –  If it works for **any** i, scenario A sees S is feasible.  \\n\\nBinary‐search S (over the range [0…(max_ai + k)×2]) in ~50 steps; each step costs O(n log n) to test scenarios A+B (sorting the costs and summing the first F).  Sum of n over all tests is ≤2×10^5, so overall O((∑n)·log n·log (10^9+k)) ≈ 2×10^5·18·32 ≲1.2×10^8, which fits in 3 sec under a well‐tuned Java solution.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Java Solution**\\n\\n```java\\nimport java.io.*;\\nimport java.util.*;\\n\\npublic class Main {\\n    static final long INF = Long.MAX_VALUE / 4;\\n\\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\\n        BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));\\n        StringTokenizer tok;\\n\\n        int T = Integer.parseInt(in.readLine());\\n        StringBuilder out = new StringBuilder();\\n\\n        while (T-- > 0) {\\n            tok = new StringTokenizer(in.readLine());\\n            int n = Integer.parseInt(tok.nextToken());\\n            long k = Long.parseLong(tok.nextToken());\\n            int F = n / 2;           // we need F = floor(n/2) raises to get median\\n\\n            // read a[], b[]\\n            long[] a = new long[n];\\n            int[] b = new int[n];\\n            tok = new StringTokenizer(in.readLine());\\n            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) a[i] = Long.parseLong(tok.nextToken());\\n            tok = new StringTokenizer(in.readLine());\\n            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) b[i] = Integer.parseInt(tok.nextToken());\\n\\n            // Make a sorted list of (value,index) so we can remove each index\\n            // and know the \\\"initial\\\" median of the other n-1 elements.\\n            Pair[] P = new Pair[n];\\n            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\\n                P[i] = new Pair(a[i], i);\\n            }\\n            Arrays.sort(P);\\n\\n            // t = position of median in a sorted of size n\\n            // for c_i of size n-1, median is at pos_c = floor((n-1 + 2)/2).\\n            // That equals floor((n+1)/2).

This lets us quickly answer, for each removed‐index i, what the *initial* median of the other n−1 entries is (call that `m0[i]`).\\n\\n2. **Binary Search on the score S.**  \\n   The final score lies in `[0…2·(max(a)+k)]`, so we binary‐search those ~60 steps to find the largest feasible `S`.\\n\\n3. **Feasibility Check `canAchieve(S)`:**  \\n   We test two **extreme** ways of spending our k ops:\\n\\n   - **Scenario B (all on champion).**  \\n     If index i has `b[i]=1`, we can add all k ops to a[i], making it `a[i]+k`.  The median of the remaining n−1 entries remains `m0[i]`.  If  \\n       \\n       `a[i] + k + m0[i] >= S`  \\n       \\n     for any i, we’re done.\\n\\n   - **Scenario A (all on median).**  \\n     We leave the champion value `a[i]` alone, and try to pump the other n−1 entries’ median up to at least `Y = S−a[i]`.  \\n     To do that, form a “cost array” over the other indices j≠i:\\n       \\n       cost_j = 0, if a[j]≥Y  \\n                Y−a[j], if a[j]<Y but b[j]=1  \\n                ∞, if a[j]<Y but b[j]=0  (we cannot raise that j)  \\n       \\n     We need at least F=⌊n/2⌋ of the other elements to be ≥Y, so we take the F smallest costs, sum them; if the sum ≤k then we can spend that many ops to bring the median to ≥Y and succeed.\\n\\nThis check costs O(n) to build and sort the costs once per i, so O(n·log n) per `canAchieve` call.  Doing ~60 binary‐search steps gives an overall O(n log n · log (max(a)+k)) which is acceptable for ∑n ≤2·10^5.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Complexity**\\n\\n- Let `N = ∑ n` over all test cases.  \\n- We do **binary search** in O(log (10^9+k)) ≈ 32…40 steps.  \\n- Each step calls `canAchieve` which is O(n log n) (sorting `n−1` costs).  \\n- Total ≈ O(N · log n · log (10^9+k)) ≤ 2·10^5·18·40 ≈ 1.44·10^8 operations.  \\n\\nWith fast I/O and low‐constant code, this fits in 3 seconds in Java.\",\n        \"refusal\": null,\n        \"role\": \"assistant\",\n        \"annotations\": [],\n        \"audio\": null,\n        \"function_call\": null,\n        \"tool_calls\": null\n      },\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"protected_material_code\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"protected_material_text\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"created\": 1753396145,\n  \"model\": \"o4-mini-2025-04-16\",\n  \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n  \"service_tier\": null,\n  \"system_fingerprint\": null,\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"completion_tokens\": 15429,\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 1054,\n    \"total_tokens\": 16483,\n    \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n      \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"reasoning_tokens\": 12096,\n      \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n    },\n    \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"cached_tokens\": 0\n    }\n  },\n  \"prompt_filter_results\": [\n    {\n      \"prompt_index\": 0,\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"jailbreak\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
