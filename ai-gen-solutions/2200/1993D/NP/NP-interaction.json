Med-imize\n\ntime limit per test2 seconds\n\nmemory limit per test256 megabytes\n\nGiven two positive integers n\n\n and k\n\n, and another array a\n\n of n\n\n integers.\n\n\n\nIn one operation, you can select any subarray of size k\n\n of a\n\n, then remove it from the array without changing the order of other elements. More formally, let (l,r)\n\n be an operation on subarray al,al+1,…,ar\n\n such that r−l+1=k\n\n, then performing this operation means replacing a\n\n with [a1,…,al−1,ar+1,…,an]\n\n.\n\n\n\nFor example, if a=[1,2,3,4,5]\n\n and we perform operation (3,5)\n\n on this array, it will become a=[1,2]\n\n. Moreover, operation (2,4)\n\n results in a=[1,5]\n\n, and operation (1,3)\n\n results in a=[4,5]\n\n.\n\n\n\nYou have to repeat the operation while the length of a\n\n is greater than k\n\n (which means |a|>k\n\n). What is the largest possible median†\n\n of all remaining elements of the array a\n\n after the process?\n\n\n\n†\n\nThe median of an array of length n\n\n is the element whose index is ⌊(n+1)/2⌋\n\n after we sort the elements in non-decreasing order. For example: median([2,1,5,4,3])=3\n\n, median([5])=5\n\n, and median([6,8,2,4])=4\n\n.\n\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t\n\n (1≤t≤104\n\n) — the number of test cases.\n\n\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers n\n\n and k\n\n (1≤n,k≤5⋅105\n\n).\n\n\n\nThe second line contains n\n\n integers a1,a2,…,an\n\n (1≤ai≤109\n\n) — the array a\n\n.\n\n\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n\n\n over all test cases does not exceed 5⋅105\n\n.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print a single integer — the largest median possible after performing the operations.\n\n\n\nExample\n\nInputCopy\n\n5\n\n4 3\n\n3 9 9 2\n\n5 3\n\n3 2 5 6 4\n\n7 1\n\n5 9 2 6 5 4 6\n\n8 2\n\n7 1 2 6 8 3 4 5\n\n4 5\n\n3 4 5 6\n\nOutputCopy\n\n3\n\n4\n\n9\n\n6\n\n4\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, you can select a subarray (l,r)\n\n which can be either (1,3)\n\n or (2,4)\n\n. Thus, two obtainable final arrays are [3]\n\n and [2]\n\n. The former one has the larger median (3>2\n\n) so the answer is 3\n\n.\n\n\n\nIn the second test case, three obtainable final arrays are [6,4]\n\n, [3,4]\n\n, and [3,2]\n\n. Their medians are 4\n\n, 3\n\n, and 2\n\n respectively. The answer is 4\n\n.\n\n\n\nIn the third test case, only one element is left in the final array and it can be any element of the initial array. The largest one among them is 9\n\n, so the answer is 9\n\n.\n\n---\n\nUse Java."

Let the final length of the array be\\n\\n-   if $n\\\\le k$, we do zero operations and keep all $n$ elements;\\n-   if $n>k$, we repeatedly subtract $k$ until the length is $\\\\le k$.  One easily checks that the final length is\\n  \\n  \\\\[\\n    r = \\n    \\\\begin{cases}\\n      n \\\\bmod k,& n \\\\bmod k\\\\neq 0,\\\\\\\\\\n      k,& n\\\\bmod k=0.\\n    \\\\end{cases}\\n  \\\\]\\n\\nDenote by $r$ this final length.  We then take the median of those $r$ elements; by definition (for an array of length $r$) the median is the $\\\\lfloor (r+1)/2\\\\rfloor$-th element in sorted order.  We wish to **maximize** that median by clever choices of which $k$-blocks to remove.\\n\\nA key combinatorial fact is that specifying which $k$-blocks to remove is exactly equivalent to choosing **one** survivor from each of the $r$ residue‐classes modulo $k$ among the original positions.  Concretely, if we index $a$ from $0$ to $n-1$, then the survivors must occupy exactly one index in each class\\n\\n\\\\[\\n  \\\\{\\\\,j,\\\\, j+k,\\\\, j+2k,\\\\dots\\\\}\\\\quad (j=0,1,\\\\dots,r-1).\\n\\\\]\\n\\nThose are disjoint runs of “would‐be deletions,” each run of non‐survivors has size a multiple of $k$, so we can peel off $k$‐blocks from it until it vanishes.\\n\\nThus the final survivors are\\n\\\\[\\n  S=\\\\{\\\\,s_0,s_1,\\\\dots,s_{r-1}\\\\},\\\\quad\\n  s_j\\\\equiv j\\\\pmod{k},\\\\quad j=0,1,\\\\dots,r-1,\\n\\\\]\\nexactly one choice per residue‐class.\\n\\nNow let $X$ be a candidate for “can we achieve median $\\\\ge X$”?  To have the median (the $\\\\lfloor (r+1)/2\\\\rfloor$-th smallest) at least $X$, we must have\\n\\n-   at least \\n    \\\\[\\n      T \\\\;=\\\\; r\\\\;-\\\\;\\\\bigl\\\\lfloor\\\\tfrac{r+1}2\\\\bigr\\\\rfloor\\\\;+\\\\;1\\n    \\\\]\\n    of our chosen survivors $\\\\ge X$,\\n-   and we pick one survivor in each of the $r$ residue‐classes.\\n\\nSo for each residue‐class $j\\\\in\\\\{0,1,\\\\dots,r-1\\\\}$, we look down the arithmetic progression\\n\\\\[\\n  j,\\\\; j+k,\\\\; j+2k,\\\\;\\\\dots\\n\\\\]\\nand ask “is there \\\\emph{any} $a[i]\\\\ge X$ in that class?”  If so we call that class _good_.  We count the number of good classes.  If the number of good classes is at least $T$, we can choose $T$ of them to contribute $\\\\ge X$ and the remaining $r-T$ arbitrarily, yielding median$\\\\ge X$.\\n\\nWe thus have a monotonic condition in $X$.  We can binary‐search on $X$ in the range $[1,\\\\max(a)]$, checking in $O(n)$ time for each $X$ whether there are at least $T$ good residue‐classes.  Overall this takes $O(n\\\\log M)$ time per test (with $M$ up to $10^9$), which is fast enough for $\\\\sum n\\\\le5\\\\times10^5$.\\n\\n---\\n\\n```java\\nimport java.io.*;\\nimport java.util.*;\\n\\npublic class Main {\\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\\n        FastReader in = new FastReader();\\n        PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(System.out);\\n\\n        int t = in.nextInt();\\n        while (t-- > 0) {\\n            int n = in.nextInt();\\n            int k = in.nextInt();\\n            int[] a = new int[n];\\n            int maxv = 0;\\n            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\\n                a[i] = in.nextInt();\\n                if (a[i] > maxv) maxv = a[i];\\n            }\\n            // Compute final length r:\\n            int r = n % k;\\n            if (r == 0) r = k;\\n            // Number of survivors we must have >= X to force median>=X:\\n            // median index = floor((r+1)/2), \\n            // so need (r - medianIndex + 1) survivors >= X.\\n            int medianIndex = (r + 1) / 2;           // floor((r+1)/2)\\n            int need = r - medianIndex + 1;\\n\\n            // Binary search on X in [1..maxv].\\n            int lo = 1, hi = maxv;\\n            while (lo < hi) {\\n                int mid = lo + (hi - lo + 1) / 2;\\n                if (canHaveAtLeast(a, n, k, r, need, mid)) {\\n                    lo = mid;\\n                } else {\\n                    hi = mid - 1;\\n                }\\n            }\\n\\n            out.println(lo);\\n        }\\n\\n        out.flush();\\n    }\\n\\n    /**\\n     * Check whether we can achieve median >= X by seeing\\n     * if at least 'need' of the r residue-classes\\n     * each contain some a[i] >= X.\\n     */\\n    static boolean canHaveAtLeast(int[] a, int n, int k, int r, int need, int X) {\\n        int countGood = 0;\\n        // We only care about the first r residue-classes: j=0..r-1.\\n        // In each, look at positions j, j+k, j+2k, ...\\n        for (int j = 0; j < r; j++) {\\n            boolean good = false;\\n            for (int pos = j; pos < n; pos += k) {\\n                if (a[pos] >= X) {\\n                    good = true;\\n                    break;\\n                }\\n            }\\n            if (good) {\\n                if (++countGood >= need) {\\n                    return true;\\n                }\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return false;\\n    }\\n\\n    /** fast I/O **/\\n    static class FastReader {\\n        BufferedReader br;\\n        StringTokenizer st;\\n        FastReader() {\\n            br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));\\n        }\\n        String next() throws IOException {\\n            while (st == null || !st.hasMoreTokens()) {\\n                String s = br.readLine();\\n                if (s == null) return null;\\n                st = new StringTokenizer(s);\\n            }\\n            return st.nextToken();\\n        }\\n        int nextInt() throws IOException {\\n            return Integer.parseInt(next());\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Explanation of Key Steps**\\n\\n1. **Final survivor‐count**  \\n   Repeatedly removing blocks of size $k$ from length $n$ until $\\\\le k$ leaves\\n   \\\\[\\n     r = \\n     \\\\begin{cases}\\n       n \\\\bmod k, & n \\\\bmod k \\\\neq 0,\\\\\\\\\\n       k, & n \\\\bmod k = 0.\\n     \\\\end{cases}\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n2. **Residue‐class decomposition**  \\n   It’s a known combinatorial fact that “deleting contiguous blocks of size $k$ until only $r$ remain” \\n   is exactly the same as “choosing exactly one survivor in each of the $r$ residue‐classes \\n   $\\\\{\\\\,j,j+k,j+2k,\\\\dots\\\\}$ for $j=0,1,\\\\dots,r-1$.”  \\n\\n3. **Median condition**  \\n   If the final sorted survivors are $c_1\\\\le c_2\\\\le \\\\cdots\\\\le c_r$, the median is $c_{\\\\lfloor (r+1)/2\\\\rfloor}$.  \\n   To force $c_{\\\\lfloor (r+1)/2\\\\rfloor}\\\\ge X$, we need **all** of $c_{\\\\lfloor (r+1)/2\\\\rfloor},\\\\dots,c_r\\\\ge X$.  \\n   That is $(r - \\\\lfloor (r+1)/2\\\\rfloor +1)$ survivors $\\\\ge X$.  \\n\\n4. **Binary search**  \\n   We binary‐search on $X$.
