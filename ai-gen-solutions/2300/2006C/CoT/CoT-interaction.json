Eri and Expanded Sets\n\ntime limit per test3 seconds\n\nmemory limit per test512 megabytes\n\nLet there be a set that contains distinct positive integers. To expand the set to contain as many integers as possible, Eri can choose two integers x≠y\n\n from the set such that their average x+y2\n\n is still a positive integer and isn't contained in the set, and add it to the set. The integers x\n\n and y\n\n remain in the set.\n\n\n\nLet's call the set of integers consecutive if, after the elements are sorted, the difference between any pair of adjacent elements is 1\n\n. For example, sets {2}\n\n, {2,5,4,3}\n\n, {5,6,8,7}\n\n are consecutive, while {2,4,5,6}\n\n, {9,7}\n\n are not.\n\n\n\nEri likes consecutive sets. Suppose there is an array b\n\n, then Eri puts all elements in b\n\n into the set. If after a finite number of operations described above, the set can become consecutive, the array b\n\n will be called brilliant.\n\n\n\nNote that if the same integer appears in the array multiple times, we only put it into the set once, as a set always contains distinct positive integers.\n\n\n\nEri has an array a\n\n of n\n\n positive integers. Please help him to count the number of pairs of integers (l,r)\n\n such that 1≤l≤r≤n\n\n and the subarray al,al+1,…,ar\n\n is brilliant.\n\n\n\nInput\n\nEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t\n\n (1≤t≤104\n\n) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.\n\n\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer n\n\n (1≤n≤4⋅105\n\n) — length of the array a\n\n.\n\n\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n\n\n integers a1,a2,…an\n\n (1≤ai≤109\n\n) — the elements of the array a\n\n.\n\n\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n\n\n over all test cases doesn't exceed 4⋅105\n\n.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single integer — the number of brilliant subarrays.\n\n\n\nExample\n\nInputCopy\n\n6\n\n2\n\n2 2\n\n6\n\n1 3 6 10 15 21\n\n5\n\n6 30 18 36 9\n\n1\n\n1000000000\n\n6\n\n1 1 4 5 1 4\n\n12\n\n70 130 90 90 90 108 612 500 451 171 193 193\n\nOutputCopy\n\n3\n\n18\n\n5\n\n1\n\n18\n\n53\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, the array a=[2,2]\n\n has 3\n\n subarrays: [2]\n\n, [2]\n\n, and [2,2]\n\n. For all of them, the set only contains a single integer 2\n\n, therefore it's always consecutive. All these subarrays are brilliant, so the answer is 3\n\n.\n\n\n\nIn the second test case, let's consider the subarray [3,6,10]\n\n. We can do operations as follows:\n\n\n\n{3,6,10}−→−−−−x=6,y=10{3,6,8,10}−→−−−−x=6,y=8{3,6,7,8,10}−→−−−−x=3,y=7{3,5,6,7,8,10}\n\n−→−−−−x=3,y=5{3,4,5,6,7,8,10}−→−−−−x=8,y=10{3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}\n\n{3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}\n\n is a consecutive set, so the subarray [3,6,10]\n\n is brilliant.\n\n---\n\nLet's think step-by-step so we don't make mistakes.

A subarray [ℓ..r] is called *brilliant* if, when we take its *set* of distinct values and repeatedly insert integer averages of any two (whenever the average is an integer and not already present), we eventually fill in *every* integer between the minimum and the maximum of that set.  Equivalently, the *closure under integer‐averaging* is exactly the full consecutive range [min…max].\\n\\nA classical fact about the “closure under taking midpoints (x+y)/2 when x+y is even” is that if you start with integer points S, then the closure is an arithmetic progression whose step is the *odd part* of the GCD of all pairwise differences in S.  Concretely, if\\n\\n g = gcd{ s–t : s,t∈S },  \\nwrite g = 2ᵏ·d with d odd.  Then the closure is the progression\\n\\n  min(S), min(S)+d, min(S)+2d, …, max(S)\\n\\nand hence it is *fully consecutive* if and only if d=1 (in which case g is a pure power of two).\\n\\nThus a subarray is brilliant ⇔ when you take its distinct values S, the GCD of all differences in S is a power of two.\\n\\n---\\n\\nWe must count all subarrays [ℓ..r] of the original array that satisfy that property.  A direct O(n²) is impossible up to n=4·10⁵.  We proceed by the standard trick of *“greedy segment-by-segment around each position as the minimum”*.\\n\\n1.  First, for each index i, compute\\n   - L[i] = the nearest index <i with a[L[i]]<a[i], or −1 if none.\\n   - R[i] = the nearest index >i with a[R[i]]<a[i], or n if none.\\n\\n   By a subarray whose minimum occurs *exactly* at i we mean ℓ> L[i], i∈[ℓ..r], r< R[i].  We cover *all* subarrays by letting i run over all possible “locations of the minimum.”\\n\\n2.  Fix i.  We only need to count subarrays [ℓ..r] with L[i]<ℓ≤i≤r< R[i] whose GCD-odd-part criterion holds.  Split into three types:\\n\\n   (a)  **Left-only**:  r=i, ℓ<i.  \\n   (b)  **Right-only**: ℓ=i, r>i.  \\n   (c)  **Crossing**:   ℓ<i<r.\\n\\n   In all these subarrays the minimal value is a[i].  Define for ℓ<i\\n   \\\\[\\n     G_L(ℓ)\\\\;=\\\\;\\\\gcd\\\\bigl\\\\{\\\\,a[j]-a[i]:\\\\, j=ℓ,ℓ+1,\\\\dots,i\\\\bigr\\\\},\\n   \\\\]\\n   and for r>i\\n   \\\\[\\n     G_R(r)\\\\;=\\\\;\\\\gcd\\\\bigl\\\\{\\\\,a[j]-a[i]:\\\\, j=i,i+1,\\\\dots,r\\\\bigr\\\\}.\\n   \\\\]\\n   Then the GCD of *all* differences in the subarray is \\\\(\\\\gcd(G_L(\\\\ell),\\\\,G_R(r))\\\\).\\n\\n   - (a) When r=i, the GCD is \\\\(G_L(ℓ)\\\\).  We want that to be a power of two.  \\n   - (b) When ℓ=i, the GCD is \\\\(G_R(r)\\\\).  We want that a power of two.  \\n   - (c) When ℓ<i<r, the GCD is \\\\(\\\\gcd\\\\bigl(G_L(ℓ),G_R(r)\\\\bigr)\\\\).  We want that also to be a pure power of two.\\n\\n3.  To do this fast, observe as ℓ moves left from i−1 down to L[i]+1, the sequence of values\\n   \\\\[\\n     G_L(i-1),\\\\;G_L(i-2),\\\\;\\\\dots,\\\\;G_L(L[i]+1)\\n   \\\\]\\n   changes only O(log M) times (where M≈10⁹ is the size of the numbers), because each step takes a gcd and once it hits 1 it stays 1 forever.  We store these “runs” in a tiny list\\n   \\\\[\\n     (g_{L,1},\\\\,w_{L,1}),\\\\,(g_{L,2},\\\\,w_{L,2}),\\\\;\\\\dots\\n   \\\\]\\n   where each g_{L,k} is a distinct gcd‐value and w_{L,k} is how many ℓ achieve that value.  Similarly build\\n   \\\\[\\n     (g_{R,1},\\\\,w_{R,1}),\\\\dots \\n   \\\\]\\n   for r from i+1 up to R[i]−1.\\n\\n4.  Then\\n\\n   - the count of type (a) is the sum of w_{L,k} over those k with g_{L,k} a power of two,\\n   - the count of type (b) is the sum of w_{R,k} over those k with g_{R,k} a power of two,\\n   - the count of type (c) is\\n     \\\\[\\n       \\\\sum_{k,\\\\,\\\\ell}\\\\;w_{L,k}\\\\;\\\\times\\\\;w_{R,\\\\ell}\\n       \\\\quad\\\\text{over all pairs $(k,\\\\ell)$ such that}\\\\;\\n       \\\\gcd\\\\bigl(g_{L,k},\\\\,g_{R,\\\\ell}\\\\bigr)\\\\text{ is a power of two.}\\n     \\\\]\\n\\nAll singletons [i..i] are trivially brilliant, so we add **n** at the very end.\\n\\nEach position i only does O(log M) work on the left, O(log M) on the right, and O((log M)²) to combine the two lists.  Since log M ≈ 30, this runs in O(n·(log M)²) comfortably within the time limit up to n=4⋅10⁵.\\n\\n---\\n\\n```java\\nimport java.io.*;\\nimport java.util.*;\\n\\npublic class Main {\\n    static int gcd(int a, int b) {\\n        while (b != 0) {\\n            int t = a % b;\\n            a = b;\\n            b = t;\\n        }\\n        return a;\\n    }\\n    // test if x is 0 or a power of two\\n    static boolean isPow2OrZero(int x) {\\n        return (x & (x - 1)) == 0;\\n    }\\n\\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\\n        BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));\\n        StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(in.readLine());\\n        int t = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\\n\\n        // Reusable arrays up to total N = 400,000\\n        int[] a = new int[400000];\\n        int[] L = new int[400000], R = new int[400000];\\n        int[] stack = new int[400000];\\n\\n        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\\n        while (t-- > 0) {\\n            st = new StringTokenizer(in.readLine());\\n            int n = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\\n            st = new StringTokenizer(in.readLine());\\n            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\\n                a[i] = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\\n            }\\n\\n            // Compute L[i] = nearest index < i with a[L[i]] < a[i], else -1\\n            int top = 0;\\n            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\\n                while (top > 0 && a[stack[top-1]] >= a[i]) {\\n                    top--;\\n                }\\n                L[i] = (top == 0 ?

We locate for each index i the **maximal span** `(L[i], R[i])` in which a[i] is the *unique* minimum (no strictly smaller value inside).  Any subarray whose minimum is at i must have `ℓ > L[i]` and `r < R[i]`.\\n\\n2. In such a subarray, every value `a[j] ≥ a[i]`.  We define\\n   ```\\n     G_L(ℓ) = gcd{ a[ℓ]−a[i], a[ℓ+1]−a[i], …, a[i]−a[i]=0 }\\n     G_R(r) = gcd{ a[i]−a[i]=0, a[i+1]−a[i], …, a[r]−a[i] }.\\n   ```\\n   Then the overall GCD of differences in [ℓ..r] is `gcd(G_L(ℓ), G_R(r))`.  That subarray is brilliant exactly when that GCD is a power of 2 (we allow 0 or powers of 2).\\n\\n3. We must count three types of subarrays ending or starting at i or crossing i:\\n   - Left‐only (r=i)\\n   - Right‐only (ℓ=i)\\n   - Crossing (ℓ<i<r)\\n\\n4. Crucially, as ℓ runs left from i−1 down to L[i]+1, the sequence of `G_L(ℓ)` can only *decrease* by dividing (gcd) and once it becomes 1 it stays 1.  Hence it has O(log M) distinct runs.  We record those runs in a small array `(value, count)`.  Similarly on the right.  Then we tally up the contributions in O((log M)²) per i.\\n\\n5. Finally we add **n** for all size‐1 subarrays (trivially brilliant).  Overall complexity is O(n·(log M)²) with M≈10⁹, which fits easily for ∑n≤4·10⁵.\",\n        \"refusal\": null,\n        \"role\": \"assistant\",\n        \"annotations\": [],\n        \"audio\": null,\n        \"function_call\": null,\n        \"tool_calls\": null\n      },\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"protected_material_code\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": true,\n          \"citation\": {\n            \"URL\": \"https://github.com/DonyaHamzeian/Inversion/tree/46419e67c26d4c003e6f5fd9c863219cff662d76/Inversion%2Fsrc%2FSolution.java\",\n            \"license\": \"NOASSERTION\"\n          }\n        },\n        \"protected_material_text\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"created\": 1753310661,\n  \"model\": \"o4-mini-2025-04-16\",\n  \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n  \"service_tier\": null,\n  \"system_fingerprint\": null,\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"completion_tokens\": 15422,\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 865,\n    \"total_tokens\": 16287,\n    \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n      \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"reasoning_tokens\": 12224,\n      \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n    },\n    \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"cached_tokens\": 0\n    }\n  },\n  \"prompt_filter_results\": [\n    {\n      \"prompt_index\": 0,\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"jailbreak\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
