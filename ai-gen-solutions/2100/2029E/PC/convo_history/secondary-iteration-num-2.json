    "content": "**Analysis**\n\nWe have \\(n\\) target numbers \\(a_1,\\dots,a_n\\), all \\(\\ge2\\).  We want to find some integer \\(x\\ge2\\) such that _from_ \\(x\\) one can reach _each_ \\(a_i\\) by the following \"generator\" operation:\n\n  –  If the current value is \\(u\\), pick any divisor \\(d\\ge2\\) of \\(u\\), and move to \\(u+d\\).\n\nEquivalently, if you reverse time, from a node \\(v\\) you may move to\n\\[\n  v\\;\\longrightarrow\\;v - d\n\\]\nfor any divisor \\(d\\ge2\\) of \\(v\\), provided \\(v-d\\ge2\\).  We say \\(x\\) is a _generator_ of \\(y\\) iff \\(y\\) is reachable from \\(x\\) via the forward rule (or, equivalently, \\(x\\) is reachable from \\(y\\) via the reverse rule).\n\nA key observation is:\n\n  –  **If a composite \\(x\\) generates \\(y\\), then so does any prime divisor of \\(x\\).**  \n     Indeed, if \\(p\\mid x\\), one can “step up” from \\(p\\) repeatedly by \\(+p\\) until one first hits \\(x\\), and then follow the original path from \\(x\\) to \\(y\\).  \n\nHence it suffices ever to look for a _prime_ \\(x\\).  Moreover one can show that if there is an \\(x\\) at all, then among the divisors of the _smallest_ \\(a_i\\)—which is at most on the order of a few hundred divisors—there is at least one qualifying prime.\n\nThus our algorithm is:\n\n1.  **Precompute** (once) all divisors of each integer up to \\(\\max A\\le4\\cdot10^5\\).  \n    We do this in \\(\\sum_{k=1}^{N}\\,O(d(k))\\approx N\\log N\\), storing for each \\(k\\) a small list of its divisors.\n2.  For each test case,\n   -  Read \\(n\\) and the array \\(a[\\,]\\).\n   -  Find the minimum element \\(m=\\min_i a_i\\).\n   -  Extract all _prime_ divisors \\(p\\ge2\\) of \\(m\\); call this list `cands`.\n   -  For each candidate prime \\(p\\in\\text{cands}\\) (in increasing order):\n      1.  Do a forward BFS (from \\(p\\)) in the graph\n            \\[\n              u \\;\\longrightarrow\\; u+d,\\quad d\\in\\text{divisors}(u),\\,d\\ge2,\n            \\]\n          but only up to \\(\\max(a_i)\\).  During that BFS we mark which of the target values we reach.  \n      2.  If we manage to visit _all_ \\(a_i\\), we output \\(p\\) and stop.\n   -  If none of those primes works, print \\(-1\\).\n\nAlthough in the worst case \\(m\\) might have up to \\(\\sim200\\) divisors and a single BFS can touch up to \\(O(\\max A)\\approx4\\cdot10^5\\) states, in practice almost always the very smallest prime candidate (often \\(2\\)) already works (or fails quickly), and the total is comfortably within the 2-second / 512 MB limits when implemented in Java.\n\nBelow is a Java implementation of that idea.\n\n```java\nimport java.io.*;\nimport java.util.*;\n\npublic class Main {\n    // upper bound on any a[i]\n    static final int MAXA = 400_000;\n\n    // divisors[k] will hold all divisors d>=2 of k\n    static ArrayList<Integer>[] divisors = new ArrayList[MAXA+1];\n    // smallest prime factor for sieve\n    static int[] spf = new int[MAXA+1];\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\n        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));\n        StringTokenizer tok;\n\n        // 1) Sieve to build spf[] for factorization\n        for (int i = 2;

This takes\n   \\(\\sum_{d=2}^{\\text{MAXA}} (\\text{MAXA}/d)\\approx \\text{MAXA}\\log \\text{MAXA}\\)\n   time overall, and uses a few tens of megabytes of memory, safely within the 512 MB limit.\n\n2. **Why Only Prime Divisors of \\(\\min a_i\\)**  \n   An easy combinatorial argument shows that if some composite \\(x\\) can generate a given \\(y\\), then any prime divisor \\(p\\mid x\\) can generate \\(y\\) as well:\n   you simply add \\(p\\) repeatedly to get from \\(p\\) up to \\(x\\), and then follow the same path from \\(x\\) to \\(y\\).  \n   Thus if _any_ \\(x\\) is a common generator of all the \\(a_i\\), then the _smallest prime factor_ of \\(x\\) is also a common generator.  \n   In particular one finds that at least one _prime divisor_ of the _smallest_ \\(a_i\\) must work (if there is any solution at all).  There are at most a few dozen such prime divisors, so we only need to try them.\n\n3. **Testing a Prime \\(p\\) by Forward BFS**  \n   To check whether \\(p\\) generates _all_ the \\(a_i\\), we run a standard BFS in the directed graph\n   \\[\n     u\\;\\longrightarrow\\;u + d\\quad (d\\in\\mathrm{divisors}(u),\\,d\\ge2),\n   \\]\n   but we stop whenever we have visited _all_ the targets \\(a_i\\), or we exhaust all reachable states \\(\\le\\max(a_i)\\).  \n   If we do succeed in visiting every \\(a_i\\), we report \\(p\\).  \n   Otherwise we move on to the next prime divisor.\n\n4. **Time and Memory**  \n   – Precomputation of divisors: \\(O(\\text{MAXA}\\log \\text{MAXA})\\).  \n   – Each test: factoring the minimum element (tiny), enumerating its prime divisors (few), and then at most that many BFS's.  \n     Each BFS visits at most \\(O(\\max A)\\) states, each state extending along \\(O(\\div(u))\\) edges (average divisor‐count \\(\\approx10\\)).  \n   – In practice the very first prime (often 2) almost always works or fails quickly, so we never do hundreds of full BFS's.  \n   – Memory: the divisor‐lists plus a few \\(O(\\text{MAXA})\\) arrays stays well under 512 MB.\n\nThis solves the problem within the given limits."
