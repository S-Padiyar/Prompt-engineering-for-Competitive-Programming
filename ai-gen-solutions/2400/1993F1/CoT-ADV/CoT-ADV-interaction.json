Dyn-scripted Robot (Easy Version)\n\ntime limit per test3 seconds\n\nmemory limit per test256 megabytes\n\nThis is the easy version of the problem. The only difference is that in this version k≤n\n\n. You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved.\n\n\n\nGiven a w×h\n\n rectangle on the Oxy\n\n plane, with points (0,0)\n\n at the bottom-left and (w,h)\n\n at the top-right of the rectangle.\n\n\n\nYou also have a robot initially at point (0,0)\n\n and a script s\n\n of n\n\n characters. Each character is either L, R, U, or D, which tells the robot to move left, right, up, or down respectively.\n\n\n\nThe robot can only move inside the rectangle; otherwise, it will change the script s\n\n as follows:\n\n\n\nIf it tries to move outside a vertical border, it changes all L characters to R's (and vice versa, all R's to L's).\n\nIf it tries to move outside a horizontal border, it changes all U characters to D's (and vice versa, all D's to U's).\n\nThen, it will execute the changed script starting from the character which it couldn't execute.\n\n\n\nAn example of the robot's movement process, s=\"ULULURD\"\n\nThe script s\n\n will be executed for k\n\n times continuously. All changes to the string s\n\n will be retained even when it is repeated. During this process, how many times will the robot move to the point (0,0)\n\n in total? Note that the initial position does NOT count.\n\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t\n\n (1≤t≤104\n\n) — the number of test cases.\n\n\n\nThe first line of each test case contains four integers n\n\n, k\n\n, w\n\n, and h\n\n (1≤n,w,h≤106\n\n; 1≤k≤n\n\n).\n\n\n\nThe second line contains a single string s\n\n of size n\n\n (si∈{L,R,U,D}\n\n) — the script to be executed.\n\n\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n\n\n over all test cases does not exceed 106\n\n.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print a single integer — the number of times the robot reaches (0,0)\n\n when executing script s\n\n for k\n\n times continuously.\n\n\n\nExample\n\nInputCopy\n\n5\n\n2 2 2 2\n\nUR\n\n4 2 1 1\n\nLLDD\n\n6 3 3 1\n\nRLRRRL\n\n5 5 3 3\n\nRUURD\n\n7 5 3 4\n\nRRDLUUU\n\nOutputCopy\n\n0\n\n4\n\n3\n\n0\n\n1\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, the robot only moves up and right. In the end, it occupies the position (2,2)\n\n but never visits (0,0)\n\n. So the answer is 0\n\n.\n\n\n\nIn the second test case, each time executing the script the robot visits the origin twice. And since k=2\n\n, it visits the origin 2⋅2=4\n\n times overall.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the third test case, the visualization is shown as below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\nYou are a competitive programming assistant solving Codeforces problems using Java. First, carefully read and restate the problem in your own words to ensure full understanding. Identify the input and output formats, list the constraints, and consider any edge cases that might affect the logic. Next, determine which algorithmic pattern the problem fits best—such as greedy, binary search, two pointers, dynamic programming, or graph traversal—and briefly explain why that pattern applies. Then, plan your solution step by step, describing the key ideas, data structures, or mathematical insights you’ll use. Once your plan is clear, write a clean and fully working Java program. Use import java.util.*; and include a Main class with a main method, using Scanner or BufferedReader for input depending on the constraints. Add comments to explain important logic in the code. After coding, walk through a sample input manually to show how your solution works in practice. Finally, analyze the time and space complexity of your approach using Big-O notation, justifying your answer. Think step by step and only write code once the logic is sound and complete."

The robot starts at \\\\((0,0)\\\\) and has a script \\\\(s\\\\) of \\\\(n\\\\) moves (each move is one of L/R/U/D).  The script is executed \\\\(k\\\\) times in a row (with \\\\(k\\\\le n\\\\), the “easy” constraint).  However, whenever the robot would step outside the rectangle on the left or right, *all* future L’s and R’s in the *remaining* script are swapped (L↔R), and likewise whenever it would step outside on the top or bottom, *all* future U’s and D’s are swapped.  Those swaps persist through the remaining moves of the current run *and* into subsequent repeats of the script.\\n\\nWe must count how many times (over all \\\\(k\\\\) runs of \\\\(s\\\\)) the robot actually *lands* on \\\\((0,0)\\\\) (not counting the initial starting position).\\n\\nA direct simulation over \\\\(k\\\\) runs of \\\\(n\\\\) moves each would be \\\\(O(k\\\\,n)\\\\), which in the worst case is up to \\\\(10^{12}\\\\) steps (since \\\\(n\\\\) and \\\\(k\\\\) can each be up to \\\\(10^6\\\\)).  That is far too big.\\n\\n**Key trick (unfolding reflections)**  \\nSwapping L↔R on hitting a vertical wall is exactly the same as imagining the robot on an infinite horizontal strip made by “unfolding” reflections of the original rectangle.  Concretely, represent each L as \\\\(\\\\Delta x=-1\\\\), R as \\\\(+1\\\\), U as \\\\(\\\\Delta y=+1\\\\), D as \\\\(-1\\\\), and let\\n\\\\[\\nX_t \\\\;=\\\\;\\\\sum_{i=1}^t \\\\Delta x_i,\\\\quad\\nY_t \\\\;=\\\\;\\\\sum_{i=1}^t \\\\Delta y_i\\n\\\\]\\nbe the *unfolded* coordinates after \\\\(t\\\\) moves.  When we fold back into the rectangle \\\\([0,w]\\\\times[0,h]\\\\),\\n\\n- We look at \\\\(X_t\\\\!\\\\bmod(2w)\\\\).  \\n  - If \\\\(X_t\\\\) mod \\\\(2w\\\\) lies in \\\\([0,w]\\\\), it goes to \\\\(x'=X_t\\\\!\\\\bmod w\\\\).  \\n  - If it lies in \\\\([w,2w)\\\\), it maps to \\\\(x'=w-(X_t\\\\!\\\\bmod w)\\\\).  \\n  - One checks that \\\\(x'=0\\\\) *exactly* when \\\\(X_t\\\\equiv0\\\\pmod{2w}\\\\).  \\n\\n- Similarly \\\\(y'=0\\\\) exactly when \\\\(Y_t\\\\equiv0\\\\pmod{2h}\\\\).\\n\\nHence the robot is back at \\\\((0,0)\\\\) in the original rectangle exactly at those steps \\\\(t\\\\) for which\\n\\\\[\\nX_t\\\\equiv 0\\\\pmod{2w}\\n\\\\quad\\\\text{and}\\\\quad\\nY_t\\\\equiv 0\\\\pmod{2h}.\\n\\\\]\\n \\nBecause the script of length \\\\(n\\\\) is repeated \\\\(k\\\\) times, the total move sequence has length \\\\(N=k\\\\,n\\\\).  Write\\n\\\\[\\nS_x=\\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\Delta x_i,\\\\quad\\nS_y=\\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\Delta y_i\\n\\\\]\\nas the *net* displacement of one full script.

For each fixed \\\\(j\\\\), this pair of congruences in \\\\(i\\\\) is solved by standard linear–congruence and Chinese‐remainder techniques.

An L move decrements \\\\(X\\\\) by 1, R increments by 1; U increments \\\\(Y\\\\), D decrements.  Visiting \\\\((0,0)\\\\) in the *folded* rectangle \\\\([0,w]\\\\times[0,h]\\\\) is equivalent to having  \\n   \\\\[\\n     X_t \\\\equiv 0\\\\pmod{2w},\\\\quad Y_t \\\\equiv 0\\\\pmod{2h}.\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n2. **Prefix sums + repetition**  \\n   Let the script of \\\\(n\\\\) moves have a *net shift* \\\\((S_x,S_y)\\\\).  After \\\\(i\\\\) *complete* runs and \\\\(j\\\\) extra moves, the robot’s unfolded coordinates are \\n   \\\\[\\n     X = i\\\\,S_x + x_j,\\\\quad Y = i\\\\,S_y + y_j,\\n   \\\\]\\n   where \\\\(x_j\\\\) is the sum of the first \\\\(j\\\\) moves’ \\\\(\\\\Delta x\\\\).  \\n   We repeat the script \\\\(k\\\\) times, so \\\\(0\\\\le i<k\\\\) and \\\\(1\\\\le j\\\\le n\\\\).\\n\\n3. **Linear congruences**  \\n   For each \\\\(j\\\\), we need \\\\(i\\\\) satisfying the simultaneous pair\\n   \\\\[\\n     i\\\\,S_x + x_j \\\\equiv 0 \\\\pmod{2w},\\\\quad\\n     i\\\\,S_y + y_j \\\\equiv 0 \\\\pmod{2h}.\\n   \\\\]\\n   Each is a single linear congruence in \\\\(i\\\\).  We solve each separately by standard division by \\\\(\\\\gcd\\\\) and (if needed) modular inversion.  That gives\\n   \\\\[\\n     i \\\\equiv u_x \\\\pmod{M_x},\\\\quad\\n     i \\\\equiv u_y \\\\pmod{M_y}.\\n   \\\\]\\n   We then use a two‐modulus CRT to merge them into one congruence\\n   \\\\[\\n     i \\\\equiv r \\\\pmod{L},\\n   \\\\]\\n   or determine that no solution exists for this \\\\(j\\\\).\\n\\n4. **Counting solutions**  \\n   Having \\\\(i\\\\equiv r\\\\pmod{L}\\\\), the valid \\\\(i\\\\)-values in \\\\(\\\\{0,1,\\\\dots,k-1\\\\}\\\\) are exactly \\n   \\\\(\\\\;r,\\\\,r+L,\\\\,r+2L,\\\\dots\\\\)  as long as they remain below \\\\(k\\\\).  \\n   The count is\\n   \\\\[\\n     \\\\begin{cases}\\n       0, & r\\\\ge k,\\\\\\\\\\n       \\\\lfloor (k-1 - r)/L\\\\rfloor + 1, & r<k.\\n     \\\\end{cases}\\n   \\\\]\\n   We add this to the global total for each \\\\(j\\\\).\\n\\nSince each test case processes the script once in \\\\(O(n)\\\\) time, and does only \\\\(O(1)\\\\) extra work per character, the total is \\\\(O(n)\\\\).
