⠀
You have some cards. An integer between 1
 and n
 is written on each card: specifically, for each i
 from 1
 to n
, you have ai
 cards which have the number i
 written on them.

There is also a shop which contains unlimited cards of each type. You have k
 coins, so you can buy at most k
 new cards in total, and the cards you buy can contain any integer between 1
 and n
, inclusive.

After buying the new cards, you must partition all your cards into decks, according to the following rules:

all the decks must have the same size;
there are no pairs of cards with the same value in the same deck.
Find the maximum possible size of a deck after buying cards and partitioning them optimally.

Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t
 (1≤t≤104
). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n
, k
 (1≤n≤2⋅105
, 0≤k≤1016
) — the number of distinct types of cards and the number of coins.

The second line of each test case contains n
 integers a1,a2,…,an
 (0≤ai≤1010
, ∑ai≥1
) — the number of cards of type i
 you have at the beginning, for each 1≤i≤n
.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n
 over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105
.

Output
For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum possible size of a deck if you operate optimally.

Note
In the first test case, you can buy one card with the number 1
, and your cards become [1,1,1,1,2,2,3,3]
. You can partition them into the decks [1,2],[1,2],[1,3],[1,3]
: they all have size 2
, and they all contain distinct values. You can show that you cannot get a partition with decks of size greater than 2
, so the answer is 2
.

In the second test case, you can buy two cards with the number 1
 and one card with the number 3
, and your cards become [1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5,5]
, which can be partitioned into [1,2,3],[1,2,4],[1,2,5],[1,2,5],[2,3,5],[2,4,5]
. You can show that you cannot get a partition with decks of size greater than 3
, so the answer is 3
.
