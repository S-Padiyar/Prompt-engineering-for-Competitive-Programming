For any vertex i\n\n (1<i≤n\n\n) in the tree, there is an edge connecting vertices i\n\n and pi\n\n (1≤pi<i\n\n), with a weight equal to ti\n\n.\n\n\n\nIris does not know the values of ti\n\n, but she knows that ∑i=2nti=w\n\n and each of the ti\n\n is a non-negative integer.\n\n\n\nThe vertices of the tree are numbered in a special way: the numbers of the vertices in each subtree are consecutive integers. In other words, the vertices of the tree are numbered in the order of a depth-first search.\n\n\n\nThe tree in this picture satisfies the condition. For example, in the subtree of vertex 2\n\n, the vertex numbers are 2,3,4,5\n\n, which are consecutive integers.\n\nThe tree in this picture does not satisfy the condition, as in the subtree of vertex 2\n\n, the vertex numbers 2\n\n and 4\n\n are not consecutive integers.\n\nWe define dist(u,v)\n\n as the length of the simple path between vertices u\n\n and v\n\n in the tree.\n\n\n\nNext, there will be n−1\n\n events:\n\n\n\nIris is given integers x\n\n and y\n\n, indicating that tx=y\n\n.\n\nAfter each event, Iris wants to know the maximum possible value of dist(i,imodn+1)\n\n independently for each i\n\n (1≤i≤n\n\n). She only needs to know the sum of these n\n\n values. Please help Iris quickly get the answers.\n\n\n\nNote that when calculating the maximum possible values of dist(i,imodn+1)\n\n and dist(j,jmodn+1)\n\n for i≠j\n\n, the unknown edge weights may be different.\n\n\n\nInput\n\nEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t\n\n (1≤t≤104\n\n) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.\n\n\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers n\n\n and w\n\n (2≤n≤2⋅105\n\n, 0≤w≤1012\n\n) — the number of vertices in the tree and the sum of the edge weights.\n\n\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n−1\n\n integers p2,p3,…,pn\n\n (1≤pi<i\n\n) — the description of the edges of the tree.\n\n\n\nThen follow n−1\n\n lines indicating the events. Each line contains two integers x\n\n and y\n\n (2≤x≤n\n\n, 0≤y≤w\n\n), indicating that tx=y\n\n.\n\n\n\nIt is guaranteed that all x\n\n in the events are distinct. It is also guaranteed that the sum of all y\n\n equals w\n\n.\n\n\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n\n\n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105\n\n.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output one line containing n−1\n\n integers, each representing the answer after each event.\n\n\n\nExample\n\nInputCopy\n\n4\n\n2 1000000000000\n\n1\n\n2 1000000000000\n\n4 9\n\n1 1 1\n\n2 2\n\n4 4\n\n3 3\n\n6 100\n\n1 2 3 2 1\n\n6 17\n\n3 32\n\n2 4\n\n4 26\n\n5 21\n\n10 511\n\n1 2 2 4 2 1 1 8 8\n\n3 2\n\n6 16\n\n10 256\n\n9 128\n\n2 1\n\n5 8\n\n8 64\n\n4 4\n\n7 32\n\nOutputCopy\n\n2000000000000\n\n25 18 18\n\n449 302 247 200 200\n\n4585 4473 2681 1567 1454 1322 1094 1022 1022\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, dist(1,2)=dist(2,1)=t2=w=1012\n\n, so dist(1,2)+dist(2,1)=2⋅1012\n\n.\n\n\n\nIn the second test case, the tree after Iris found out all tx\n\n is shown below:\n\n\n\n\n\ndist(1,2)=t2\n\n, dist(2,3)=t2+t3\n\n, dist(3,4)=t3+t4\n\n, dist(4,1)=t4\n\n. After the first event, she found out that t2=2\n\n, so dist(1,2)=2\n\n. At the same time:\n\n\n\ndist(2,3)\n\n is maximized if t3=7\n\n, t4=0\n\n. Then dist(2,3)=9\n\n.\n\ndist(3,4)\n\n and dist(4,1)\n\n are maximized if t3=0\n\n, t4=7\n\n. Then dist(3,4)=dist(4,1)=7\n\n.\n\nThus, the answer is 2+9+7+7=25\n\n.\n\n\n\nAfter the second event, she found out that t4=4\n\n, then t3=w−t2−t4=4\n\n. dist(1,2)=2\n\n, dist(2,3)=2+3=5\n\n, dist(3,4)=3+4=7\n\n, dist(4,1)=4\n\n. Thus, the answer is 2+5+7+4=18\n\n.\n\n---\n\nLet's think step-by-step so we don't make mistakes. Use Java. Avoid syntax errors or infinite loops."
