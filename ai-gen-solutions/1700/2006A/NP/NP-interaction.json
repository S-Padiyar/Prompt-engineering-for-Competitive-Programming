Each vertex has a value of 0\n\n or 1\n\n.\n\n\n\nLet's consider a leaf of the tree (the vertex 1\n\n is never considered a leaf) and define its weight. Construct a string formed by the values of the vertices on the path starting at the root and ending in this leaf. Then the weight of the leaf is the difference between the number of occurrences of 10\n\n and 01\n\n substrings in it.\n\n\n\nTake the following tree as an example. Green vertices have a value of 1\n\n while white vertices have a value of 0\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's calculate the weight of the leaf 5\n\n: the formed string is 10110\n\n. The number of occurrences of substring 10\n\n is 2\n\n, the number of occurrences of substring 01\n\n is 1\n\n, so the difference is 2−1=1\n\n.\n\nLet's calculate the weight of the leaf 6\n\n: the formed string is 101\n\n. The number of occurrences of substring 10\n\n is 1\n\n, the number of occurrences of substring 01\n\n is 1\n\n, so the difference is 1−1=0\n\n.\n\nThe score of a tree is defined as the number of leaves with non-zero weight in the tree.\n\n\n\nBut the values of some vertices haven't been decided and will be given to you as ?\n\n. Filling the blanks would be so boring, so Iris is going to invite Dora to play a game. On each turn, one of the girls chooses any of the remaining vertices with value ?\n\n and changes its value to 0\n\n or 1\n\n, with Iris going first. The game continues until there are no vertices with value ?\n\n left in the tree. Iris aims to maximize the score of the tree, while Dora aims to minimize that.\n\n\n\nAssuming that both girls play optimally, please determine the final score of the tree.\n\n\n\nInput\n\nEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t\n\n (1≤t≤5⋅104\n\n) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.\n\n\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer n\n\n (2≤n≤105\n\n) — the number of vertices in the tree.\n\n\n\nThe following n−1\n\n lines each contain two integers u\n\n and v\n\n (1≤u,v≤n\n\n) — denoting an edge between vertices u\n\n and v\n\n.\n\n\n\nIt's guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.\n\n\n\nThe last line contains a string s\n\n of length n\n\n. The i\n\n-th character of s\n\n represents the value of vertex i\n\n. It's guaranteed that s\n\n only contains characters 0\n\n, 1\n\n and ?\n\n.\n\n\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n\n\n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2⋅105\n\n.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single integer — the final score of the tree.\n\n\n\nExample\n\nInputCopy\n\n6\n\n4\n\n1 2\n\n1 3\n\n4 1\n\n0101\n\n4\n\n1 2\n\n3 2\n\n2 4\n\n???0\n\n5\n\n1 2\n\n1 3\n\n2 4\n\n2 5\n\n?1?01\n\n6\n\n1 2\n\n2 3\n\n3 4\n\n5 3\n\n3 6\n\n?0????\n\n5\n\n1 2\n\n1 3\n\n1 4\n\n1 5\n\n11?1?\n\n2\n\n2 1\n\n??\n\nOutputCopy\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, all the values of the vertices have been determined. There are three different paths from the root to a leaf:\n\n\n\nFrom vertex 1\n\n to vertex 2\n\n. The string formed by the path is 01\n\n, so the weight of the leaf is 0−1=−1\n\n.\n\nFrom vertex 1\n\n to vertex 3\n\n. The string formed by the path is 00\n\n, so the weight of the leaf is 0−0=0\n\n.\n\nFrom vertex 1\n\n to vertex 4\n\n. The string formed by the path is 01\n\n, so the weight of the leaf is 0−1=−1\n\n.\n\nThus, there are two leaves with non-zero weight, so the score of the tree is 2\n\n.\n\n\n\nIn the second test case, one of the sequences of optimal choices for the two players can be:\n\n\n\nIris chooses to change the value of the vertex 3\n\n to 1\n\n.\n\nDora chooses to change the value of the vertex 1\n\n to 0\n\n.\n\nIris chooses to change the value of the vertex 2\n\n to 0\n\n.\n\nThe final tree is as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe only leaf with non-zero weight is 3\n\n, so the score of the tree is 1\n\n. Note that this may not be the only sequence of optimal choices for Iris and Dora.\n\n---\n\nUse Java."

Iris moves first and wants to **maximize** the score; Dora moves second and wants to **minimize** it.\\n\\nCrucially, **internal** vertices with `'?'` (i.e.\\\\ non‐root, non‐leaf) do *not* affect the score at all.  They are mere “dummy” moves: picking one of those simply burns a turn without changing any leaf or root bit.  However, burning turns (using up such `'?'` on internal nodes) can be used strategically to flip whose turn it is when we get around to assigning the root or the leaves.  \\n\\nWe therefore split the game into two phases:\\n\\n1. **Root‐assignment phase**, as long as the root is still `?`.  \\n2. **Leaf‐assignment phase**, once the root is fixed, each leaf `'?'` is assigned in turn by whoever’s move it is.\\n\\nLet\\n\\n- \\\\(a_0\\\\)=\\\\# of leaves already fixed to `0`,  \\n- \\\\(a_1\\\\)=\\\\# of leaves already fixed to `1`,  \\n- \\\\(q\\\\)=\\\\# of leaves that are still `?`,  \\n- \\\\(d\\\\)=\\\\# of “dummy” `?` – i.e.\\\\ internal vertices (non‐root, non‐leaf) that are `?`,  \\n- \\\\(r\\\\)=1 if the root is `?`, else 0.  \\n\\nIf the root is already fixed to \\\\(R\\\\in\\\\{0,1\\\\}\\\\), the base‐score from the fixed leaves is\\n\\n\\\\[\\n   \\\\text{base} \\\\;=\\\\;\\n   \\\\begin{cases}\\n     a_1, & R=0,\\\\\\\\\\n     a_0, & R=1,\\n   \\\\end{cases}\\n\\\\]\\n\\nand then the leaves get assigned in alternating fashion starting with Iris.  Since there are \\\\(q\\\\) leaves,\\n\\n- Iris gets \\\\(\\\\lceil q/2\\\\rceil\\\\) picks (each pick can force “mismatch” with the root and so give +1),\\n- Dora gets \\\\(\\\\lfloor q/2\\\\rfloor\\\\) picks (each pick will match the root to give 0).\\n\\nHence when the root is pre‐fixed,\\n\\n\\\\[\\n  \\\\text{answer}\\n  \\\\;=\\\\;\\n  \\\\text{base}\\n  \\\\;+\\\\;\\\\bigl\\\\lceil \\\\tfrac{q}{2}\\\\bigr\\\\rceil.\\n\\\\]\\n\\n---\\n\\nIf the root is `?`, then both players fight over _who_ gets to set the root (and thus pick its bit in \\\\(\\\\{0,1\\\\}\\\\)).  Whoever sets the root also _controls_ which side starts the leaf‐assignment phase:\\n\\n- If _Iris_ sets the root, then the _next_ move is Dora’s, so Dora starts leaf‐assignment and Iris gets \\\\(\\\\lfloor q/2\\\\rfloor\\\\) leaves.\\n- If _Dora_ sets the root, then Iris starts leaves and gets \\\\(\\\\lceil q/2\\\\rceil\\\\).\\n\\nMoreover when the root is finally set to \\\\(R\\\\), the fixed‐leaves contribution is\\n\\n\\\\[\\n  \\\\text{base}_R\\n  \\\\;=\\\\;\\n  \\\\begin{cases}\\n    a_1,&R=0,\\\\\\\\\\n    a_0,&R=1,\\n  \\\\end{cases}\\n\\\\]\\n\\nand Iris will choose \\\\(R\\\\) (if she is the one assigning the root) so as to _maximize_ \\\\(\\\\text{base}_R +\\\\) (her leaf‐picks), while Dora (if she assigns the root) chooses \\\\(R\\\\) to _minimize_ that same quantity.\\n\\nFinally the interior `?`s (the \\\\(d\\\\) dummy moves) can be spent _before_ the root gets set, to flip whose turn it is at the crucial moment of root‐assignment.  A simple mini–minimax / DP shows that if one lets\\n\\n\\\\[\\n   X = \\\\max(a_0,a_1)\\\\;+\\\\;\\\\lfloor q/2\\\\rfloor,\\n   \\\\qquad\\n   Y = \\\\min(a_0,a_1)\\\\;+\\\\;\\\\lceil q/2\\\\rceil,\\n\\\\]\\n\\nthen (when \\\\(r=1\\\\)) the value of the game is\\n\\n\\\\[\\n   \\\\text{answer}\\n   =\\n   \\\\begin{cases}\\n     X, & d\\\\equiv0\\\\pmod2,\\\\\\\\\\n     \\\\max(X,Y), & d\\\\equiv1\\\\pmod2.\\n   \\\\end{cases}\\n\\\\]\\n\\nPutting all cases together gives an \\\\(O(n)\\\\) per‐test solution once one has counted\\n\\\\(\\\\;a_0,a_1,q,d\\\\;\\\\).\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Implementation in Java**\\n\\n```java\\nimport java.io.*;\\nimport java.util.*;\\n\\npublic class Main {\\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\\n        BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));\\n        PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(System.out);\\n\\n        int t = Integer.parseInt(in.readLine());\\n        while (t-- > 0) {\\n            int n = Integer.parseInt(in.readLine());\\n            int[] deg = new int[n+1];\\n            for (int i = 0; i < n-1; i++) {\\n                StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(in.readLine());\\n                int u = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\\n                int v = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\\n                deg[u]++;\\n                deg[v]++;\\n            }\\n            String s = in.readLine();\\n            \\n            // Count leaves (i>1 with deg[i]==1), fixed leaves, leaf '?', total '?'\\n            int a0 = 0, a1 = 0, leafQ = 0, totalQ = 0;\\n            for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\\n                char c = s.charAt(i-1);\\n                if (c == '?') totalQ++;\\n                // leaf = deg[i]==1 and i!=1\\n                if (i != 1 && deg[i] == 1) {\\n                    if (c == '0')      a0++;\\n                    else if (c == '1') a1++;\\n                    else               leafQ++;\\n                }\\n            }\\n\\n            // How many non-root non-leaf '?' remain = dummy moves\\n            boolean rootQ = (s.charAt(0) == '?');\\n            int d = totalQ - (rootQ ? 1 : 0) - leafQ;\\n\\n            int answer;\\n            if (!rootQ) {\\n                // root is already fixed\\n                int R = s.charAt(0) - '0';\\n                int base = (R == 0 ? a1 : a0);\\n                // Iris starts the leaf picks, she gets ceil(leafQ/2)\\n                int irisLeaves = (leafQ + 1) / 2;\\n                answer = base + irisLeaves;\\n            } else {\\n                // root is '?': two-phase minimax with d dummy moves\\n                int Bmax = Math.max(a0, a1);\\n                int Bmin = Math.min(a0, a1);\\n                int floorHalf = leafQ / 2;\\n                int ceilHalf  = (leafQ + 1) / 2;\\n                int X = Bmax + floorHalf;   // if Iris manages root (and thus Dora starts leaves)\\n                int Y = Bmin + ceilHalf;    // if Dora manages root (and thus Iris starts leaves)\\n                if ((d & 1) == 0) {\\n                    // even number of dummies → Iris can guarantee the X‐scenario\\n                    answer = X;\\n                } else {\\n                    // odd number of dummies → she can force the better of X,Y\\n                    answer = Math.max(X, Y);\\n                }\\n            }\\n\\n            out.println(answer);\\n        }\\n        out.flush();\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Explanation of Key Steps**\\n\\n1. **Counting leaves**  \\n   A node \\\\(i\\\\neq1\\\\) with \\\\(\\\\deg(i)=1\\\\) is a leaf.  We count three types among leaves:\\n   - `a0`: leaves fixed to `'0'`.\\n   - `a1`: leaves fixed to `'1'`.\\n   - `leafQ`: leaves still `?`.\\n\\n2. **Dummy moves**  \\n   Any `?` that is neither the root (if the root was `?`) nor one of those `leafQ` leaves is a _dummy_–node.  Let `d` be their count.\\n\\n3. **Case 1:** root is already `0` or `1`  \\n   Then the root’s bit is fixed.  The leaves are assigned in strict alternation, beginning with Iris, on the `leafQ` remaining leaves.  Iris therefore gets \\\\(\\\\lceil \\\\tfrac{leafQ}{2}\\\\rceil\\\\) leaf‐assignments (each can be chosen to create a “mismatch” and yield +1 to the score).  Dora’s picks produce 0.  Add that to the base from the already-fixed leaves.\\n\\n4. **Case 2:** root is `?`  \\n   Whichever player assigns the root gets to pick the root‐bit ​_and_​ forces the next move to be the _other_ player’s.  \\n   - If Iris assigns the root, she makes it the bit that maximizes her fixed‐leaf base \\\\(\\\\max(a0,a1)\\\\), and _then_ Dora starts the leaves → Iris gets \\\\(\\\\lfloor leafQ/2\\\\rfloor\\\\) more points.  Call that \\\\(X\\\\).  \\n   - If Dora assigns the root, she forces \\\\(\\\\min(a0,a1)\\\\) as the base, and Iris then starts the leaves → Iris gets \\\\(\\\\lceil leafQ/2\\\\rceil\\\\).  Call that \\\\(Y\\\\).  \\n   Before root‐assignment both players may spend dummy‐moves to flip turn‐parity.  A small DP or direct parity argument shows that with \\\\(d\\\\) dummy moves available, the minimax value is\\n   \\\\[\\n      \\\\text{Ans}\\n      = \\\\begin{cases}\\n         X, & d\\\\text{ even},\\\\\\\\\\n         \\\\max(X,Y), & d\\\\text{ odd}.\\n       \\\\end{cases}\\n   \\\\]\\n\\nThis runs in \\\\(O(n)\\\\) per test (just one pass to compute degrees and then to tally the three leaf‐counts and the dummy‐count), which is more than fast enough for \\\\(n\\\\le10^5\\\\) and up to \\\\(t\\\\) with total \\\\(n\\\\le2\\\\cdot10^5\\\\).\",\n        \"refusal\": null,\n        \"role\": \"assistant\",\n        \"annotations\": [],\n        \"audio\": null,\n        \"function_call\": null,\n        \"tool_calls\": null\n      },\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"protected_material_code\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": true,\n          \"citation\": {\n            \"URL\": \"https://github.com/AhmedAmr/CompProgSolutions/tree/1ee585251fd80e8db50adb71e723fb141e3065e5/10370%20-%20Above%20Average%2Fsrc%2FMain.java\",\n            \"license\": \"NOASSERTION\"\n          }\n        },\n        \"protected_material_text\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"created\": 1753309537,\n  \"model\": \"o4-mini-2025-04-16\",\n  \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n  \"service_tier\": null,\n  \"system_fingerprint\": null,\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"completion_tokens\": 20884,\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 1061,\n    \"total_tokens\": 21945,\n    \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n      \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"reasoning_tokens\": 18432,\n      \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n    },\n    \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"cached_tokens\": 0\n    }\n  },\n  \"prompt_filter_results\": [\n    {\n      \"prompt_index\": 0,\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"jailbreak\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
