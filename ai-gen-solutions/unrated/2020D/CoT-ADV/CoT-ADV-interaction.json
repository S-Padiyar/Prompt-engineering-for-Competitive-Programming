Connect the Dots\n\ntime limit per test2 seconds\n\nmemory limit per test512 megabytes\n\nOne fine evening, Alice sat down to play the classic game \"Connect the Dots\", but with a twist.\n\n\n\nTo play the game, Alice draws a straight line and marks n\n\n points on it, indexed from 1\n\n to n\n\n. Initially, there are no arcs between the points, so they are all disjoint. After that, Alice performs m\n\n operations of the following type:\n\n\n\nShe picks three integers ai\n\n, di\n\n (1≤di≤10\n\n), and ki\n\n.\n\nShe selects points ai,ai+di,ai+2di,ai+3di,…,ai+ki⋅di\n\n and connects each pair of these points with arcs.\n\nAfter performing all m\n\n operations, she wants to know the number of connected components†\n\n these points form. Please help her find this number.\n\n\n\n†\n\n Two points are said to be in one connected component if there is a path between them via several (possibly zero) arcs and other points.\n\n\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t\n\n (1≤t≤105\n\n). The description of the test cases follows.\n\n\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers n\n\n and m\n\n (1≤n≤2⋅105\n\n, 1≤m≤2⋅105\n\n).\n\n\n\nThe i\n\n-th of the following m\n\n lines contains three integers ai\n\n, di\n\n, and ki\n\n (1≤ai≤ai+ki⋅di≤n\n\n, 1≤di≤10\n\n, 0≤ki≤n\n\n).\n\n\n\nIt is guaranteed that both the sum of n\n\n and the sum of m\n\n over all test cases do not exceed 2⋅105\n\n.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output the number of connected components.\n\n\n\nExample\n\nInputCopy\n\n3\n\n10 2\n\n1 2 4\n\n2 2 4\n\n100 1\n\n19 2 4\n\n100 3\n\n1 2 5\n\n7 2 6\n\n17 2 31\n\nOutputCopy\n\n2\n\n96\n\n61\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, there are n=10\n\n points. The first operation joins the points 1\n\n, 3\n\n, 5\n\n, 7\n\n, and 9\n\n. The second operation joins the points 2\n\n, 4\n\n, 6\n\n, 8\n\n, and 10\n\n. There are thus two connected components: {1,3,5,7,9}\n\n and {2,4,6,8,10}\n\n.\n\n\n\nIn the second test case, there are n=100\n\n points. The only operation joins the points 19\n\n, 21\n\n, 23\n\n, 25\n\n, and 27\n\n. Now all of them form a single connected component of size 5\n\n. The other 95\n\n points form single-point connected components. Thus, the answer is 1+95=96\n\n.\n\n\n\nIn the third test case, there are n=100\n\n points. After the operations, all odd points from 1\n\n to 79\n\n will be in one connected component of size 40\n\n. The other 60\n\n points form single-point connected components. Thus, the answer is 1+60=61\n\n.\n\n---\n\nYou are a competitive programming assistant solving Codeforces problems using Java. First, carefully read and restate the problem in your own words to ensure full understanding. Identify the input and output formats, list the constraints, and consider any edge cases that might affect the logic. Next, determine which algorithmic pattern the problem fits best—such as greedy, binary search, two pointers, dynamic programming, or graph traversal—and briefly explain why that pattern applies. Then, plan your solution step by step, describing the key ideas, data structures, or mathematical insights you’ll use. Once your plan is clear, write a clean and fully working Java program. Use import java.util.*; and include a Main class with a main method, using Scanner or BufferedReader for input depending on the constraints. Add comments to explain important logic in the code. After coding, walk through a sample input manually to show how your solution works in practice. Finally, analyze the time and space complexity of your approach using Big-O notation, justifying your answer. Think step by step and only write code once the logic is sound and complete."

Finally, we must print the number of connected components in the resulting graph.\\n\\nNaively, one could union‐find over the n points, and for each operation perform all k unions of consecutive AP‐neighbors (that already suffices to link the whole clique by transitivity).  But since k can be as large as O(n)=2⋅10^5 and there may be O(2⋅10^5) operations, doing ∑ k unions explicitly could be quadratic in n in the worst case.\\n\\nWe exploit two facts:\\n\\n1. The number of distinct d’s is at most 10 (d∈[1…10]).  \\n2. Across all operations with the same d, each potential edge (x, x+d) between a vertex x and x+d can only ever need to be added once.  Once we add it, every future “clique‐on‐AP” operation with the same d will find it already present and skip it.\\n\\nWe implement one Disjoint‐Set-Union (DSU) over vertices [1…n] to maintain connectivity, plus a “next‐pointer” trick for each d∈[1…10]:\\n\\n— We allocate an array next[d][1…n+1], initialized so next[d][i]=i for all i.  \\n— To “remove” (mark processed) the edge‐start i (meaning we unite i and i+d), we do\\n\\n  next[d][i] = FindNext(d, i+d)\\n\\nso that future searches for the “next unprocessed start ≥ i” will jump to i+d (or beyond, if that too has been processed).\\n\\n— FindNext(d,x) walks up next[d] pointers (with path compression) to return the smallest y ≥ x for which next[d][y]=y (i.e. y is still unprocessed).\\n\\nWhen we handle an operation (a,d,k), its APSegment is a + j·d for j=0…k.  The edges we need are precisely the (k) edges  \\n(a, a+d), (a+d, a+2d), …, (a+(k−1)d, a+k·d).  \\nWe loop:\\n\\n  x = FindNext(d,a);  \\n  while(x + d ≤ a + k·d) {  \\n     DSU.union(x, x+d);             // merge these two points\\n     next[d][x] = FindNext(d, x+d); // mark edge(x,x+d) done\\n     x = next[d][x];                // jump to next start ≥ x\\n  }\\n\\nEach edge‐start i (i.e. potential edge (i, i+d)) is ever removed at most once, so overall we do O(n·10) = O(n) DSU‐unions and pointer‐hops across all operations.  Since ∑n, ∑m ≤2·10^5, this runs in softly linear time.\\n\\nBelow is a self‐contained Java implementation using BufferedReader for fast I/O.\\n\\n```java\\nimport java.io.*;\\nimport java.util.*;\\n\\npublic class Main {\\n    static class DSU {\\n        int[] parent, rank;\\n        int count;\\n        DSU(int n) {\\n            parent = new int[n+1];\\n            rank   = new int[n+1];\\n            for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\\n                parent[i] = i;\\n                rank[i] = 0;\\n            }\\n            count = n;\\n        }\\n        int find(int x) {\\n            // iterative find with path‐compression\\n            int root = x;\\n            while (parent[root] != root) {\\n                root = parent[root];\\n            }\\n            while (parent[x] != x) {\\n                int p = parent[x];\\n                parent[x] = root;\\n                x = p;\\n            }\\n            return root;\\n        }\\n        void union(int a, int b) {\\n            int ra = find(a), rb = find(b);\\n            if (ra == rb) return;\\n            // union by rank\\n            if (rank[ra] < rank[rb]) {\\n                parent[ra] = rb;\\n            } else if (rank[ra] > rank[rb]) {\\n                parent[rb] = ra;\\n            } else {\\n                parent[rb] = ra;\\n                rank[ra]++;\\n            }\\n            count--;\\n        }\\n    }\\n\\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\\n        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));\\n        StringTokenizer st;\\n        int t = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine().trim());\\n        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\\n        while (t-- > 0) {\\n            st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\\n            int n = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\\n            int m = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\\n\\n            // Initialize DSU for the n points:\\n            DSU dsu = new DSU(n);\\n\\n            // nextEdge[d][i] = the smallest j >= i such that edge (j, j+d) is still unprocessed.\\n            // We'll keep it of size (n+2), 1-based.\\n            int[][] nextEdge = new int[11][n+2];\\n            for (int d = 1; d <= 10; d++) {\\n                for (int i = 1; i <= n+1; i++) {\\n                    nextEdge[d][i] = i;\\n                }\\n            }\\n\\n            // Helper to find next unprocessed start >= x for difference d\\n            // with path compression:\\n            class Finder {\\n                int findNext(int d, int x) {\\n                    int r = x;\\n                    while (r <= n && nextEdge[d][r] != r) {\\n                        r = nextEdge[d][r];\\n                    }\\n                    // path-compress\\n                    int cur = x;\\n                    while (cur <= n && nextEdge[d][cur] != cur) {\\n                        int tmp = nextEdge[d][cur];\\n                        nextEdge[d][cur] = r;\\n                        cur = tmp;\\n                    }\\n                    return r;\\n                }\\n            }\\n            Finder finder = new Finder();\\n\\n            // Process m operations\\n            for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {\\n                st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\\n                int a = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\\n                int d = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\\n                int k = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\\n                int last = a + k*d;\\n\\n                // We want to add edges (x, x+d) for x = a, a+d, ... , a+(k-1)*d\\n                // but skip any already done.\\n                int x = finder.findNext(d, a);\\n                while (x + d <= last) {\\n                    dsu.union(x, x + d);\\n                    // mark this x as done, by pointing it forward\\n                    int nx = finder.findNext(d, x + d);\\n                    nextEdge[d][x] = nx;\\n                    x = nx;\\n                }\\n            }\\n\\n            // The DSU.count field is the number of connected components.\\n            sb.append(dsu.count).append('\\\\n');\\n        }\\n        System.out.print(sb);\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nExplanation of the main ideas:\\n\\n1. We only ever need to link each potential edge \\\\((i,i+d)\\\\) once.  \\n2. For fixed \\\\(d\\\\in[1..10]\\\\), we keep an array `nextEdge[d]` of size \\\\(\\\\le n+1\\\\).  Initially `nextEdge[d][i]=i`.  \\n3. Whenever we process and add the edge \\\\((i,i+d)\\\\), we “remove” index \\\\(i\\\\) by setting  \\n       nextEdge[d][i] = FindNext(d, i+d),  \\n   so that future searches for “the next unprocessed start ≥ i” skip over it in \\\\(O(\\\\alpha(n))\\\\) amortized time.  \\n4. Summed across all operations, there are at most \\\\(\\\\sum_{d=1}^{10}(n-d)=O(n)\\\\) such distinct edges, so we do only \\\\(O(n)\\\\) DSU unions in total.  \\n5. Remaining DSU operations (finds, path compressions) also stay in \\\\(O(n\\\\alpha(n))\\\\).  \\n\\nThus the overall complexity is \\\\(O((n+m)\\\\,\\\\alpha(n))\\\\) per test, comfortably within the \\\\(n,m\\\\le2\\\\cdot10^5\\\\) limits.\",\n        \"refusal\": null,\n        \"role\": \"assistant\",\n        \"annotations\": [],\n        \"audio\": null,\n        \"function_call\": null,\n        \"tool_calls\": null\n      },\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"protected_material_code\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": true,\n          \"citation\": {\n            \"URL\": \"https://github.com/jjuyeon/Problem-Solving/tree/8be58dcef5157473b36156ec8c10cda6b4f0decb/SWEA%2FD4_3289.java\",\n            \"license\": \"NOASSERTION\"\n          }\n        },\n        \"protected_material_text\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"created\": 1753326435,\n  \"model\": \"o4-mini-2025-04-16\",\n  \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n  \"service_tier\": null,\n  \"system_fingerprint\": null,\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"completion_tokens\": 9110,\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 935,\n    \"total_tokens\": 10045,\n    \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n      \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"reasoning_tokens\": 7232,\n      \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n    },\n    \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"cached_tokens\": 0\n    }\n  },\n  \"prompt_filter_results\": [\n    {\n      \"prompt_index\": 0,\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"jailbreak\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
