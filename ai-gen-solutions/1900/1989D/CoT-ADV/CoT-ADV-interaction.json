Smithing Skill\n\ntime limit per test3 seconds\n\nmemory limit per test256 megabytes\n\nYou are playing a famous computer game (that just works) where you have various skills you can level up. Today, you focused on the \"Smithing\" skill. Your tactic is obvious: forging weapons from ingots and then melting them back to return the materials partially. For simplicity, every time you create an item, you get 1\n\n experience point, and every time you melt an item, you also get 1\n\n experience point.\n\n\n\nThere are n\n\n classes of weapons you can forge and m\n\n types of metal ingots.\n\n\n\nYou can create one weapon of the i\n\n-th class, spending ai\n\n ingots of metal of the same type. Melting a weapon of the i\n\n-th class (which you crafted earlier) returns you bi\n\n ingots of the type of metal it was made of.\n\n\n\nYou have cj\n\n metal ingots of the j\n\n-th type, and you know that you can craft a weapon of any class from any metal type. Each combination of a weapon class and a metal type can be used any number of times.\n\n\n\nWhat is the maximum total amount of experience you can earn by crafting and melting weapons?\n\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n\n\n and m\n\n (1≤n,m≤106\n\n) — the number of weapon classes and metal types.\n\n\n\nThe second line contains n\n\n integers a1,a2,…,an\n\n (1≤ai≤106\n\n), where ai\n\n is the number of ingots you need to forge one weapon of the i\n\n-th class.\n\n\n\nThe third line contains n\n\n integers b1,b2,…,bn\n\n (0≤bi<ai\n\n), where bi\n\n is the number of ingots you return by melting one weapon of the i\n\n-th class you forged earlier.\n\n\n\nThe fourth line contains m\n\n integers c1,c2,…,cm\n\n (1≤cj≤109\n\n) — the number of ingots you have of the corresponding metal type.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nPrint one integer — the maximum total experience points you can gain by repeatedly forging and melting weapons.\n\n\n\nExamples\n\nInputCopy\n\n5 3\n\n9 6 7 5 5\n\n8 4 5 1 2\n\n10 4 7\n\nOutputCopy\n\n12\n\nInputCopy\n\n3 4\n\n10 20 20\n\n0 0 0\n\n9 10 19 20\n\nOutputCopy\n\n8\n\nInputCopy\n\n1 5\n\n3\n\n1\n\n1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000\n\nOutputCopy\n\n4999999990\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, you can do the following:\n\n\n\ncraft one weapon of the 1\n\n-st class from the 1\n\n-st type of metal, spending 9\n\n ingots;\n\nmelt that weapon, returning 8\n\n ingots of the 1\n\n-st metal type;\n\nagain, craft and melt one weapon of the 1\n\n-st class from the 1\n\n-st metal type;\n\ncraft and melt one weapon of the 3\n\n-rd class from the 1\n\n-st metal type;\n\ncraft and melt one weapon of the 3\n\n-rd class from the 3\n\n-rd metal type;\n\ncraft and melt one weapon of the 4\n\n-th class from the 1\n\n-st metal type;\n\ncraft and melt one weapon of the 5\n\n-th class from the 3\n\n-rd metal type;\n\nIn the end you'll have c=[2,4,2]\n\n ingots left. In total, you've crafted 6\n\n weapons and melted 6\n\n weapons, gaining 12\n\n experience points in total.\n\n---\n\nYou are a competitive programming assistant solving Codeforces problems using Java. First, carefully read and restate the problem in your own words to ensure full understanding. Identify the input and output formats, list the constraints, and consider any edge cases that might affect the logic. Next, determine which algorithmic pattern the problem fits best—such as greedy, binary search, two pointers, dynamic programming, or graph traversal—and briefly explain why that pattern applies. Then, plan your solution step by step, describing the key ideas, data structures, or mathematical insights you’ll use. Once your plan is clear, write a clean and fully working Java program. Use import java.util.*; and include a Main class with a main method, using Scanner or BufferedReader for input depending on the constraints. Add comments to explain important logic in the code. After coding, walk through a sample input manually to show how your solution works in practice. Finally, analyze the time and space complexity of your approach using Big-O notation, justifying your answer. Think step by step and only write code once the logic is sound and complete."

For each class \\\\(i\\\\):\\n  - `a[i]` = number of ingots needed to **forge** one weapon of this class.\\n  - `b[i]` = number of ingots returned when you **melt** that weapon.   \\n  It is guaranteed \\\\(0 \\\\le b[i] < a[i]\\\\).\\n- \\\\(m\\\\) metal **types**. For each metal type \\\\(j\\\\):\\n  - `c[j]` = the number of ingots of that type you initially have.\\n\\nYou may, any number of times and in any order:\\n1. pick a weapon class \\\\(i\\\\) and a metal type \\\\(j\\\\) (you must have at least `a[i]` ingots of type \\\\(j\\\\) on hand),\\n2. **forge** a weapon of class \\\\(i\\\\) (costs you `a[i]` ingots, + 1 experience),\\n3. **melt** that weapon back immediately (gives you back `b[i]` ingots of the same type, + 1 experience).\\n\\nEach forge gives +1 EXP and each melt gives +1 EXP. You end up with fewer overall ingots (net cost per cycle = `a[i] − b[i] > 0`), but you gain \\\\(2\\\\) EXP per “forge+immediate melt” cycle.\\n\\nYou want to maximize total EXP across all metal types.  You never gain by forging without melting (that would be \\\\(+1\\\\) EXP at net cost `a[i]`, whereas any full cycle is \\\\(+2\\\\) EXP at net cost `a[i]−b[i]\\\\) — strictly better EXP per ingot).\\n\\n**Key Observation (Greedy by “net cost”)**\\n\\n- Define for each weapon class \\\\(i\\\\) its *net cost*  \\n  \\\\(d_i = a[i] - b[i]\\\\).  \\n- Every complete cycle (forge+ melt) gives 2 EXP at net cost \\\\(d_i\\\\).  \\n- To maximize the *number* of cycles (hence \\\\(2\\\\times\\\\) that in EXP), at each step you want the weapon with the **smallest** net cost \\\\(d_i\\\\)—because that uses the fewest ingots per 2 EXP.\\n- However, you can only use class \\\\(i\\\\) so long as your *current stock* of ingots for that metal type remains at least `a[i]`, because forging needs `a[i]` up‐front before melting returns `b[i]`.\\n\\nThus the greedy per metal‐type is:\\n\\n  1. **Among all classes whose `a[i] ≤ current_stock`, pick the one with minimum `d[i]`.**  \\n  2. Do as many full cycles of that class as you can _in one batch_ (so you don't loop one‐by‐one):\\n     - If your stock is \\\\(C\\\\), the chosen class has (`a`, `d`) = (`a*`, `d*`),\\n       you can do  \\n         \\\\[\\n            t = \\\\Bigl\\\\lfloor\\\\frac{C - a^*}{d^*}\\\\Bigr\\\\rfloor \\\\;+\\\\;1\\n         \\\\]\\n       cycles, each costing \\\\(d^*\\\\) net.  \\n     - Decrease \\\\(C\\\\) by \\\\(t \\\\times d^*\\\\), increase EXP by \\\\(2t\\\\).  \\n  3. Repeat until no class is usable.\\n\\nDoing this naively per metal type in \\\\(O(n)\\\\) or so is too big because \\\\(n,m\\\\) can be up to \\\\(10^6\\\\).  We instead do the following preprocessing:\\n\\n**Preprocessing**\\n\\n1. Let \\\\(\\\\maxA = \\\\max_i a[i]\\\\).  Build an array  \\n   `bestD[x]` = minimal \\\\(d_i\\\\) among all classes with `a[i] == x`.  (If none, set to +∞.)\\n2. Build a prefix minima for \\\\(x=1\\\\ldots \\\\maxA\\\\):\\n   - `prefD[x] = min(prefD[x-1], bestD[x])`.\\n   - Also track `bestA[x]`, the `a[i]` that achieves that minimal `prefD[x]`.  (If `bestD[x]` wins, `bestA[x] = x`, else inherit from \\\\(x-1\\\\).)\\n3. Now for any stock \\\\(C\\\\):\\n   - If \\\\(C>\\\\maxA\\\\), clamp to `x = maxA`; else `x = C`.\\n   - Then the best cycle class when you have \\\\(C\\\\) ingots is described by `(d = prefD[x], a = bestA[x])`.\\n\\nThis preprocessing is \\\\(O(n + \\\\maxA)\\\\).  Here \\\\(\\\\maxA\\\\le 10^6\\\\) so it's linear.\\n\\n**Per‐Metal‐Type Simulation (in \\\\(\\\\#\\\\text{groups}\\\\) steps)**\\n\\nFor each metal‐type stock \\\\(C\\\\), do:\\n  1. Look up `(d,a)` as above.  \\n  2. If `d == INF` or `C < a`, stop.  \\n  3. Compute  \\n        `t = (C - a)/d + 1`,  \\n     add `2*t` to `ans`, do `C -= t*d`.  \\n  4. Repeat.\\n\\nIn the worst theoretical case this loop could iterate once for every “change in which class is best,” which could be up to \\\\(n\\\\), but in typical constraints and in C++ this passes within time.  In Java with careful I/O, it can pass under 3 s.\\n\\n**Complexities**\\n\\n- Preprocessing: \\\\(O(n + A_{\\\\max})\\\\).\\n- Per metal type: potentially up to \\\\(O(\\\\text{#distinct best‐class changes})\\\\), but in practice far fewer.
