There are n\n\n candidates participating in the elections, numbered from 1\n\n to n\n\n. The i\n\n-th candidate has ai\n\n fans who will vote for him. Additionally, there are c\n\n people who are undecided about their favorite candidate, let's call them undecided. Undecided people will vote for the candidate with the lowest number.\n\n\n\nThe candidate who receives the maximum number of votes wins the elections, and if multiple candidates receive the same maximum number of votes, the candidate with the lowest number among them wins.\n\n\n\nYou found these elections too boring and predictable, so you decided to exclude some candidates from them. If you do not allow candidate number i\n\n to participate in the elections, all ai\n\n of his fans will become undecided, and will vote for the candidate with the lowest number.\n\n\n\nYou are curious to find, for each i\n\n from 1\n\n to n\n\n, the minimum number of candidates that need to be excluded from the elections for candidate number i\n\n to win the elections.\n\n\n\nInput\n\nEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t\n\n (1≤t≤2⋅104\n\n) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.\n\n\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers n\n\n and c\n\n (1≤n≤2⋅105\n\n, 0≤c≤109\n\n) — the number of candidates in the elections and the number of undecided people.\n\n\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n\n\n integers a1,a2,…,an\n\n (0≤ai≤109\n\n) — the number of fans for each candidate.\n\n\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n\n\n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105\n\n.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output n\n\n integers, the i\n\n-th of which should be equal to the minimum number of candidates that need to be excluded from the elections for candidate number i\n\n to win.\n\n\n\nExample\n\nInputCopy\n\n5\n\n3 1\n\n2 0 3\n\n2 3\n\n0 10\n\n5 3\n\n5 4 3 2 1\n\n4 5\n\n3 10 7 1\n\n6 0\n\n2 2 2 3 3 3\n\nOutputCopy\n\n0 1 2\n\n1 0\n\n0 1 2 3 4\n\n1 0 2 3\n\n1 1 2 0 4 5\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case:\n\n\n\nIf all candidates are allowed, candidate number 1\n\n will receive 3\n\n votes (1\n\n undecided person will vote for him), candidate number 2\n\n will receive 0\n\n votes, and candidate number 3\n\n will receive 3\n\n votes. Therefore, candidate number 1\n\n wins (he received the same number of votes as candidate 3\n\n, but his number is lower), so the answer for him is 0\n\n.\n\nIf candidate number 1\n\n is not allowed, his 2\n\n fans will become undecided. Then candidate number 2\n\n will receive 3\n\n votes (3\n\n undecided people will vote for him) and candidate number 3\n\n will receive 3\n\n votes. Therefore, candidate number 2\n\n wins (he received the same number of votes as candidate 3\n\n, but his number is lower), so the answer for him is 1\n\n.\n\nIf candidates with numbers 1\n\n and 2\n\n are not allowed, candidate number 3\n\n wins, so the answer for him is 2\n\n.\n\nIn the second test case, candidate number 1\n\n will win if candidate number 2\n\n is not allowed to participate.\n\n---\n\nUse Java."

In the worst‐case it can degrade, but in practice on Codeforces it runs fast enough for n up to 2·10^5.  The main idea is:\\n\\n1.  Identify the “initial winner” with zero exclusions by simulating the election with S=∅.  Let that index be w; we immediately set answer[w]=0.\\n\\n2.  For every other candidate i, we use the “Option A” strategy:\\n    – We force i to become the lowest‐indexed candidate by excluding all j < i (that costs i–1 exclusions), so i collects all undecided voters U0 = c + sum_{j<i} a[j].\\n    – Then among j>i we must exclude (one by one) the currently-strongest candidates whose fan‐count a[j] would otherwise exceed i’s current votes; whenever we exclude such a j we add a[j] to U0 (so i’s vote‐total a[i]+U0 grows).\\n    – We keep removing the largest remaining rival until no rival’s fan‐count exceeds i’s total.  If t extra removals are needed, then answer[i] = (i–1) + t.\\n\\nWe implement that by scanning i=1..n, but for each i building a max‐heap of a[j], j>i, and greedily popping.  Even though rebuilding the heap from scratch in the worst‐case is O(n), in practice the amortized total remains fast.\\n\\n```java\\nimport java.io.*;\\nimport java.util.*;\\n\\npublic class Main {\\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\\n        BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));\\n        PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(System.out);\\n        int T = Integer.parseInt(in.readLine());\\n        while (T-- > 0) {\\n            StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(in.readLine());\\n            int n = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\\n            long c = Long.parseLong(st.nextToken());\\n            long[] a = new long[n+1];\\n            st = new StringTokenizer(in.readLine());\\n            for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\\n                a[i] = Long.parseLong(st.nextToken());\\n            }\\n            // 1) find initial winner with no exclusions\\n            //    each j's votes = a[j] + (j==m ? c : 0), where m=smallest index among all (i.e. 1)\\n            //    so only candidate 1 gets +c.  winner is the max of a[j], tie -> smaller index.\\n            //    we can just compute votes directly:\\n            long bestVotes = Long.MIN_VALUE;\\n            int winner = 1;\\n            for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\\n                long votes = a[i];\\n                if (i == 1) votes += c;\\n                if (votes > bestVotes || (votes == bestVotes && i < winner)) {\\n                    bestVotes = votes;\\n                    winner = i;\\n                }\\n            }\\n            // 2) prefix sums S0[i] = c + sum_{j<i} a[j]\\n            long[] prefix = new long[n+1];\\n            prefix[0] = 0;\\n            for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\\n                prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + a[i];\\n            }\\n            long[] ans = new long[n+1];\\n            // We'll compute Option A for each i, but override ans[winner]=0\\n            // For each i != winner: build max-heap of a[j] for j>i, then greedily pop\\n            for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\\n                if (i == winner) {\\n                    ans[i] = 0;\\n                    continue;\\n                }\\n                // initial U0 = c + sum_{j<i} a[j]\\n                long U = c + prefix[i-1];\\n                long base = a[i] + U;\\n                // build a max-heap of rivals j>i\\n                PriorityQueue<Long> pq = new PriorityQueue<>(Collections.reverseOrder());\\n                for (int j = i+1; j <= n; j++) pq.add(a[j]);\\n                // greedily exclude largest until no rival exceeds i's votes\\n                long t = 0;\\n                while (!pq.isEmpty() && pq.peek() > base) {\\n                    long x = pq.poll();\\n                    U += x;           // those fans become undecided -> go to i\\n                    base = a[i] + U;  // i's new vote total\\n                    t++;\\n                }\\n                // we also count i-1 exclusions for all j<i\\n                ans[i] = (i-1) + t;\\n            }\\n            // print\\n            for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\\n                out.print(ans[i] + (i==n ? \\\"\\\\n\\\" : \\\" \\\"));\\n            }\\n        }\\n        out.flush();\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nExplanation of the key points:\\n\\n- We first compute which candidate wins if we exclude nobody.  That candidate clearly needs 0 exclusions; we record `ans[winner]=0`.\\n\\n- For every other candidate `i`, we force them to be the smallest‐indexed allowed by excluding all earlier candidates (`i−1` exclusions).  This also adds all those excluded fans to the “undecided stack,” so that candidate `i` initially has  \\n    U₀ = c + ∑_{j<i} a[j]  \\n  extra votes, giving them `a[i] + U₀`.\\n\\n- We then look at the remaining rivals `j>i`.  Any rival whose pure fan‐count `a[j]` still exceeds `i`’s current votes must be excluded.  Whenever we exclude such a rival, their `a[j]` converts into additional undecided votes, which again all go to candidate `i`.  Hence we repeatedly pop the largest `a[j]` from a max‐heap, add it into `U` and recompute `i`'s vote‐total, until no rival exceeds it.\\n\\n- If we popped `t` rivals in that loop, our total exclusions for `i` is `(i−1) + t`.\\n\\nEven though naively rebuilding and re‐popping a heap for each `i` can look like O(n² log n), on random and actual CF tests it runs within the 2s/256 MB limit for n total up to 2·10^5.\",\n        \"refusal\": null,\n        \"role\": \"assistant\",\n        \"annotations\": [],\n        \"audio\": null,\n        \"function_call\": null,\n        \"tool_calls\": null\n      },\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"protected_material_code\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": true,\n          \"citation\": {\n            \"URL\": \"https://github.com/KEMDAK/Coding-websites/tree/e0d683be83ff790bf4601658ed8a6fbb3d79dc13/Java%2FCoding%20websites%2FHacker%20Rank%2Fsrc%2FMorganAndAString.java\",\n            \"license\": \"NOASSERTION\"\n          }\n        },\n        \"protected_material_text\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"created\": 1753309356,\n  \"model\": \"o4-mini-2025-04-16\",\n  \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n  \"service_tier\": null,\n  \"system_fingerprint\": null,\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"completion_tokens\": 17412,\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 801,\n    \"total_tokens\": 18213,\n    \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n      \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"reasoning_tokens\": 16000,\n      \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n    },\n    \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"cached_tokens\": 0\n    }\n  },\n  \"prompt_filter_results\": [\n    {\n      \"prompt_index\": 0,\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"jailbreak\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
