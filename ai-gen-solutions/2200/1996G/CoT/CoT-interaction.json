We choose a subset of those cycle‐edges to “maintain.”  There are \\\\(m\\\\) friendship‐pairs \\\\((a,b)\\\\).  For each friendship, the two houses \\\\(a,b\\\\) must remain connected in the subgraph of maintained edges.\\n\\nBecause we only need each friendship‐component to be internally connected (we do **not** need the *entire* graph to be connected), each connected component of the friendship‐graph can be treated separately.  Let one friendship‐component span the set of vertices\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\{v_1,v_2,\\\\dots,v_k\\\\}\\n\\\\]\\n(in sorted order around the cycle).  To keep those \\\\(k\\\\) vertices connected on the cycle, one can pick a minimal contiguous arc of cycle‐edges that covers all of them.  Concretely:\\n\\n1.  Sort the vertices \\\\(v_1< v_2<\\\\cdots<v_k\\\\).\\n2.  Form the \\\\(k\\\\) gaps (along the cycle)  \\n   \\\\[\\n     d_i = v_{i+1}-v_i\\\\quad (i=1\\\\ldots k-1), \\n     \\\\quad d_k = (v_1 + n) - v_k\\n   \\\\]\\n   (the last one wraps from \\\\(v_k\\\\) back to \\\\(v_1\\\\)).\\n3.  Let \\\\(d_{\\\\rm max}\\\\) be the largest of these \\\\(k\\\\) gaps.  Then the *complementary* arc (the cycle minus that largest gap) is the minimal contiguous set of edges connecting all \\\\(v_i\\\\).  Its size is\\n   \\\\[\\n      n - d_{\\\\rm max}.\\n   \\\\]\\n   We also record where that arc *starts* on the cycle so that we can later take the union across different components.\\n\\nThus each friendship‐component yields one (possibly wrapping) interval of cycle‐edges of length \\\\(n-d_{\\\\max}\\\\).  Since distinct friendship‐components do not need paths between them, we simply take the union of those arcs (over all components) and count how many distinct edges appear in that union.\\n\\nThe union of intervals on a cycle is handled by breaking any wrapping interval into two intervals on \\\\([1\\\\ldots n]\\\\) (one at the high end, one at the low end), collecting *all* these intervals, sorting by start, and then sweeping to compute the total covered length.\\n\\nOverall complexity:\\n– Building DSU and unioning \\\\(m\\\\) pairs:  \\\\(O(m\\\\alpha(n))\\\\)  \\n– For each node (there are \\\\(\\\\le n\\\\) nodes in friendships) finding its root and gathering it: \\\\(O(n\\\\alpha(n))\\\\)  \\n– For each component sorting its \\\\(k\\\\) nodes: sum of all \\\\(k\\\\) is \\\\(\\\\le 2m\\\\), so \\\\(O(m\\\\log m)\\\\) in the worst case  \\n– Collecting up to \\\\(2\\\\) intervals per component \\\\(\\\\implies O(m)\\\\)  \\n– Sorting all intervals \\\\(\\\\implies O(m\\\\log m)\\\\)  \\n– Final union‐length sweep \\\\(\\\\implies O(m)\\\\)\\n\\nSince \\\\(\\\\sum n,\\\\sum m\\\\le2\\\\cdot10^5\\\\) over all test cases, this runs easily in time.\\n\\n---\\n\\n```java\\nimport java.io.*;\\nimport java.util.*;\\n\\npublic class Main {\\n    static class DSU {\\n        int[] p, r;\\n        DSU(int n) {\\n            p = new int[n+1];\\n            r = new int[n+1];\\n            for(int i = 1;

After that, each DSU “root” represents one connected component of the friendship graph.\\n\\n2.  **Gather vertices per component**  \\n    We only care about vertices that appear in some friendship.  We loop over \\\\(v=1\\\\ldots n\\\\), and if `involved[v]` is `true`, we push \\\\(v\\\\) into a list for its DSU root.\\n\\n3.  **Minimal arc for each component**  \\n    Suppose a component’s vertices (on the cycle) are\\n    \\\\[\\n       v_1 < v_2 < \\\\cdots < v_k.\\n    \\\\]\\n    The gaps along the cycle are\\n    \\\\[\\n       d_i = v_{i+1}-v_i \\\\quad (i=1\\\\ldots k-1),\\n       \\\\quad\\n       d_k = (v_1 + n) - v_k.\\n    \\\\]\\n    The largest gap \\\\(d_{\\\\max}\\\\) we *omit*, and keep the *complementary* arc of length\\n    \\\\[\\n       n - d_{\\\\max}.\\n    \\\\]\\n    That complementary arc is a contiguous block of edges on the cycle connecting all \\\\(v_i\\\\).  \\n\\n4.  **Splitting wrap‐around**  \\n    If that chosen arc wraps past edge \\\\(n\\\\) back to \\\\(1\\\\), we split it into two intervals \\\\([s,n]\\\\) and \\\\([1,e]\\\\).  Otherwise we record a single interval \\\\([s,e]\\\\).\\n\\n5.  **Union of all intervals**  \\n    Finally we have up to \\\\(2\\\\) intervals per friendship‐component.  We sort them by left endpoint, sweep them to compute the union length in \\\\(O(M\\\\log M)\\\\), where \\\\(M\\\\) is the total number of intervals (at most \\\\(2m\\\\)).  \\n\\nThe total number of kept edges is exactly the size of this union.\",\n        \"refusal\": null,\n        \"role\": \"assistant\",\n        \"annotations\": [],\n        \"audio\": null,\n        \"function_call\": null,\n        \"tool_calls\": null\n      },\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"protected_material_code\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": true,\n          \"citation\": {\n            \"URL\": \"https://github.com/wcysai/Calabash/tree/2b5ec06c4818aacbbe3ba0c71377f10f354afbc9/Petrozavodsk%20Summer-2015.%20Xudyh%20Contest%2FC.cpp\",\n            \"license\": \"NOASSERTION\"\n          }\n        },\n        \"protected_material_text\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"created\": 1753310480,\n  \"model\": \"o4-mini-2025-04-16\",\n  \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n  \"service_tier\": null,\n  \"system_fingerprint\": null,\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"completion_tokens\": 13730,\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 532,\n    \"total_tokens\": 14262,\n    \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n      \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"reasoning_tokens\": 11328,\n      \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n    },\n    \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"cached_tokens\": 0\n    }\n  },\n  \"prompt_filter_results\": [\n    {\n      \"prompt_index\": 0,\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"jailbreak\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
