**Problem Restatement**

We have an uppercase text string *s* of length *n*, over an alphabet of size *c* (the first *c* letters 'A', 'B', …). The ancient language's words can be at most *k* letters long, and each word's _case_ is determined by its last letter.  If the language does _not_ have a case for some letter X, then no word in the language may end in X.

The spaces between words have been lost, so the given string *s* must be segmentable into consecutive words, each of length ≤ *k*, in such a way that _every_ word ends in one of the letters for which the language _does_ have cases.

We must choose a subset *S* of the letters of minimal size (this size is our answer) such that:

1. Every word in a valid segmentation ends in a letter of *S*.
2. Every word length ≤ *k*.
3. The segmentation covers the entire text (so in particular the last letter *s[n–1]* must belong to *S*).

We want the minimal possible |*S*|.

---

**Key Observation and Reduction**

- If we decide that the language has cases exactly for the set *S* of letters, then in any segmentation we may end a word at _any_ occurrence of a letter in *S_.  
- To cover the entire text in segments of length ≤ *k*, the _distance_ between consecutive segment-end positions cannot exceed *k*.  Concretely, if you look at the positions where the letter lies in *S*, those positions (plus a dummy "0" at the start) must never be more than *k* apart.
- Equivalently, there must be **no** run of length *k* in the text that contains _zero_ letters from *S_.  In other words, _every_ substring of length *k* must contain at least one letter from *S_.  (That enforces that you cannot go k positions without seeing a possible word-end.)

Thus our problem becomes:

- We must pick a subset *S* of the *c* letters that:
  1. Always hits every contiguous window of length *k* in the text (so that no k-length block is free of an allowed ending letter).
  2. Contains the final letter of the text *s[n–1]* (so that the last word can end at the end).
- Minimize |*S*|.

---

**Equivalent “Forbidden Window” Formulation via Complements**

Let *U* be the complement of *S* (the letters for _which_ we have _no_ case).  Then requiring that _every_ window of length *k* has at least one letter from *S* is the same as saying:

> _No_ window of length *k* is composed entirely of letters from *U*.

So to test whether a given *U* is valid:

- For each contiguous window of length *k*, we take the set of distinct letters appearing in that window—call its bitmask `m`.  
- If `m` is a subset of *U* (i.e. `(m & ~U) == 0`), then that window is entirely forbidden letters, and *U* is invalid.
- Otherwise *U* is okay.

We also must ensure the last letter (say index `e`) is _not_ in *U*, because we do need `s[n–1] ∈ S`, so `e ∉ U`.

We want the _largest_ possible *U* (so that *S* = complement is as small as possible) under these constraints.

---

**Algorithm**

1. **Edge case**: if `n ≤ k`, then we can take the _entire_ text as one word, so we only need one case: whatever letter `s[n–1]` is.  Answer = 1.

2. **Collect “window-masks”**  
   We slide a length-k window over the text.  There are `n–k+1` windows, each window contributes a mask `m` of which letters appear in that window.  We record in a boolean array `forbidden[m] = true` for each such mask `m`.

3. **Mark invalid complements**  
   We want to mark all subsets `U` of `{0..c−1}` that _contain_ any of those window‐masks entirely.  In bit‐mask terms, we want to mark every `U` that has a subset `m` with `forbidden[m] == true`.  
   A standard “superset‐fill” trick:  
   - Initialize `bad[m] = forbidden[m]`.  
   - For each `bit` from 0 to `c−1`, for each mask `M`, if `M` has that `bit` set, then `bad[M] |= bad[M ^ (1<<bit)]`.  
   After this, `bad[U]` is true whenever `U` covers at least one forbidden mask.

4. **Pick the largest valid U**  
   We iterate `U` from `0` to `(1<<c)–1`.  Keep only those with:
   - `bad[U] == false`  (no k-window is fully inside `U`)
   - `(U & (1<<e)) == 0` (the last‐letter index `e` is _not_ in `U`)
   Among those, take the maximum popcount(`U`).  Call it `bestU`.

5. **Answer** = `c − bestU`.

Overall complexity per test is `O(n + c·2^c)`, and constraints guarantee that across all tests ∑n ≤ 2^18 and ∑2^c ≤ 2^18, so it runs in a few million operations total.

**Explanation of Key Steps**

1. **Sliding-window masks**  
   We maintain a count of each of the *c* letters in the current window of length *k*, and a bitmask of which letters have nonzero count.  Every time the window moves one step to the right, we update counts and the mask in O(1).  We mark `forbidden[mask] = true` for each window.

2. **Superset‐DP to mark bad complements**  
   We want any set *U* that contains (as a subset) a forbidden‐mask to be marked bad.  A classic technique: initialize `bad[m] = forbidden[m]`, then for each bit, for each mask, if `mask` has that bit, we `bad[mask] |= bad[mask ^ (1<<bit)]`.  This propagates "badness" upwards through supersets in O(c·2^c).

3. **Selecting the final answer**  
   From all subsets *U* that are not `bad` and do _not_ include the final letter, we pick the one with the largest popcount.  Its complement has the minimal number of letters (cases) needed.

Time Complexity:
- Sliding-window: O(n).
- Superset DP: O(c · 2^c).
- Iteration to find best U: O(2^c).
Summing over all test cases stays within about 5 million operations (since ∑n ≤2^18 and ∑2^c ≤2^18), which is efficient for the time limits. 

Space Complexity:
- O(2^c) for the `forbidden` and `bad` arrays (up to 2^18 boolean entries) plus O(n) for the input string.
