Let's construct a square matrix b\n\n of size n×n\n\n, in which the i\n\n-th row contains the array a\n\n cyclically shifted to the right by (i−1)\n\n. For example, for the array a=[3,4,5]\n\n, the obtained matrix is\n\n\n\nb=⎡⎣⎢354435543⎤⎦⎥\n\n\n\nLet's construct the following graph:\n\n\n\nThe graph contains n2\n\n vertices, each of which corresponds to one of the elements of the matrix. Let's denote the vertex corresponding to the element bi,j\n\n as (i,j)\n\n.\n\nWe will draw an edge between vertices (i1,j1)\n\n and (i2,j2)\n\n if |i1−i2|+|j1−j2|≤k\n\n and gcd(bi1,j1,bi2,j2)>1\n\n, where gcd(x,y)\n\n denotes the greatest common divisor of integers x\n\n and y\n\n.\n\nYour task is to calculate the number of connected components†\n\n in the obtained graph.\n\n\n\n†\n\nA connected component of a graph is a set of vertices in which any vertex is reachable from any other via edges, and adding any other vertex to the set violates this rule.\n\n\n\nInput\n\nEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t\n\n (1≤t≤105\n\n) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.\n\n\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers n\n\n and k\n\n (2≤n≤106\n\n, 2≤k≤2⋅106\n\n) — the length of the array and the parameter k\n\n.\n\n\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n\n\n integers a1,a2,…,an\n\n (1≤ai≤106\n\n) — the elements of the array a\n\n.\n\n\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n\n\n over all test cases does not exceed 106\n\n.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single integer — the number of connected components in the obtained graph.\n\n\n\nExample\n\nInputCopy\n\n6\n\n3 3\n\n3 4 5\n\n3 3\n\n3 4 9\n\n3 2\n\n3 4 9\n\n2 2\n\n2 8\n\n5 3\n\n8 27 5 4 3\n\n4 10\n\n2 2 2 2\n\nOutputCopy\n\n3\n\n2\n\n3\n\n1\n\n4\n\n1\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, the matrix b\n\n is given in the statement.

The third connected component contains the vertices (1,3)\n\n, (2,1)\n\n, and (3,2)\n\n. Thus, the graph has 3\n\n connected components.\n\n\n\nIn the second test case, the following matrix is obtained:\n\n\n\nb=⎡⎣⎢394439943⎤⎦⎥\n\n\n\nThe first connected component contains all vertices corresponding to elements with values 3\n\n and 9\n\n. The second connected component contains all vertices corresponding to elements with the value 4\n\n.\n\n\n\nIn the fourth test case, all vertices are in one connected component.\n\n---\n\nLet's think step-by-step so we don't make mistakes.

Clearly we cannot build the graph explicitly.  We exploit the special circulant structure:\\n\\n-  Each **diagonal** \\\\(u\\\\) (where \\\\(j-i\\\\equiv u\\\\pmod n\\\\)) carries the constant value \\\\(a[u]\\\\).  \\n-  Within one diagonal, if \\\\(a[u]=1\\\\) then \\\\(\\\\gcd(1,1)=1\\\\) so **no** two cells on that diagonal ever connect; all \\\\(n\\\\) of its cells are isolated singletons.  \\n-  If \\\\(a[u]>1\\\\), those \\\\(n\\\\) cells on diagonal \\\\(u\\\\) do connect “along” the diagonal in two contiguous runs (unless \\\\(k\\\\ge n\\\\), in which case the wrap‐around step also joins them into a single loop).  Hence on diagonal \\\\(u\\\\) with \\\\(a[u]>1\\\\) we have\\n     - \\\\(2\\\\) “segments” (two linear runs) if \\\\(k<n\\\\) and \\\\(u\\\\neq0\\\\),\\n     - \\\\(1\\\\) segment if \\\\(k\\\\ge n\\\\) **or** \\\\(u=0\\\\).  \\n\\nThat tells us how many connected pieces each *single* diagonal would contribute if it never talks to any other diagonal.\\n\\nBut diagonals *do* talk to each other whenever (a) they share a prime factor, and (b) their diagonal‐indices \\\\(u,v\\\\) differ by at most \\\\(k\\\\) *cyclically* (so that there is at least one pair of cells \\\\((i,j)\\\\) in diagonal \\\\(u\\\\) and \\\\((i',j')\\\\) in diagonal \\\\(v\\\\) at manhattan‐distance \\\\(\\\\le k\\\\)).\\n\\nIt turns out one can show that *all* those inter‐diagonal contacts merge the entire group of involved diagonals into a single component, except when a diagonal stands completely alone (no other diagonal with which it shares a prime factor at cyclic‐distance \\\\(\\\\le k\\\\)).  \\n\\nHence the recipe:\\n\\n1.  **Special case** each diagonal \\\\(u\\\\) with \\\\(a[u]=1\\\\): it contributes \\\\(n\\\\) singleton components (none of those cells ever connect to anything).  \\n2.  For the remaining diagonals (those with \\\\(a[u]>1\\\\)) build a small “meta‐graph” on the set of indices \\\\(u\\\\).  \\n    -  We place an (undirected) edge between \\\\(u\\\\) and \\\\(v\\\\) iff \\n       1. \\\\(\\\\gcd(a[u],a[v])>1\\\\), and  \\n       2. their cyclic index‐distance \\\\(\\\\min(|u-v|,\\\\,n-|u-v|)\\\\le k\\\\).  \\n    -  We compute connected components in that meta‐graph (of size at most \\\\(n\\\\)).  \\n3.  If a meta‐component has size \\\\(>1\\\\), all its diagonals (and all their sub‐segments) merge into *one* big component in the big grid.  \\n4.  If a meta‐component is a singleton \\\\(\\\\{u\\\\}\\\\), then it contributes exactly the number of segments we would have had *just* from diagonal \\\\(u\\\\) alone, namely  \\n   \\\\[\\n     \\\\text{segments}(u)\\\\;=\\\\;\\n       \\\\begin{cases}\\n         n, &a[u]=1,\\\\\\\\\\n         1, &a[u]>1\\\\text{ and either }u=0\\\\text{ or }k\\\\ge n,\\\\\\\\\\n         2, &a[u]>1\\\\text{ and }u\\\\ne0\\\\text{ and }k<n.\\n       \\\\end{cases}\\n   \\\\]\\n5.  Sum everything.\\n\\nTo implement step (2) efficiently, we:\\n\\n- Precompute a sieve of smallest‐prime‐factor (SPF) up to \\\\(10^6\\\\).  \\n- For each test case, for each diagonal \\\\(u\\\\) with \\\\(a[u]>1\\\\) we factor \\\\(a[u]\\\\) by repeated SPF‐division, extracting its *distinct* prime factors.  We keep for each prime \\\\(p\\\\) a list of all diagonals that carry a multiple of \\\\(p\\\\).  \\n- Then **for each prime** \\\\(p\\\\), we have a sorted list of diagonals `pos[]`.  We union‐join all *consecutive* pairs in that list whose linear index‐difference \\\\(\\\\le k\\\\), plus if the wrap‐around distance `(pos[0] + n – pos[m-1]) ≤ k` we also join those two.  By transitivity that connects *every* pair of diagonals whose cyclic index distance \\\\(\\\\le k\\\\).  \\n- After processing all primes, we run a DSU‐(disjoint set) to get meta‐components.  \\n\\nEach test runs in about \\\\(O(n\\\\log n)\\\\) total (the factorization via SPF is \\\\(O(\\\\log a_i)\\\\), summing to \\\\(O(n\\\\log A)\\\\), plus the DSU unions which are linear in the total prime‐lists size).
