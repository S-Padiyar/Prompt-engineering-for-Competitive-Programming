Determine Winning Islands in Race\n\ntime limit per test2 seconds\n\nmemory limit per test256 megabytes\n\nMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO\n\n— Bessie the Cow, The Art of Racing on Islands\n\nTwo of Farmer John's cows, Bessie and Elsie, are planning to race on n\n\n islands. There are n−1\n\n main bridges, connecting island i\n\n to island i+1\n\n for all 1≤i≤n−1\n\n. Additionally, there are m\n\n alternative bridges. Elsie can use both main and alternative bridges, while Bessie can only use main bridges. All bridges are one way and can only be used to travel from an island with a lower index to an island with a higher index.\n\n\n\nInitially, Elsie starts on island 1\n\n, and Bessie starts on island s\n\n. The cows alternate turns, with Bessie making the first turn. Suppose the cow is on island i\n\n. During a cow's turn, if there are any bridges connecting island i\n\n to island j\n\n, then the cow can move to island j\n\n. Then, island i\n\n collapses, and all bridges connecting to island i\n\n also collapse. Also, note the following:\n\n\n\nIf there are no bridges connecting island i\n\n to another island, then island i\n\n collapses, and this cow is eliminated from the race.\n\nIf the other cow is also on island i\n\n, then after this cow moves to another island, the island collapses, and the other cow is eliminated from the race.\n\nAfter an island or bridge collapses, no cows may use them.\n\nIf a cow is eliminated, their turn is skipped for the rest of the race.\n\nThe race ends once either cow reaches island n\n\n. It can be shown that regardless of the cows' strategies, at least one cow reaches island n\n\n. Bessie wins if and only if she reaches island n\n\n first.\n\n\n\nFor each 1≤s≤n−1\n\n, determine whether Bessie wins if she starts the race on island s\n\n. Assume both cows follow optimal strategies to ensure their own respective victories.\n\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains t\n\n (1≤t≤104\n\n) – the number of test cases.\n\n\n\nThe first line of each test case contains n\n\n and m\n\n (2≤n≤2⋅105\n\n, 0≤m≤2⋅105\n\n) – the number of islands and the number of alternative bridges.\n\n\n\nThe next m\n\n lines of each test case contain u\n\n and v\n\n (1≤u<v≤n\n\n) – the islands that the alternative bridge connects. It is guaranteed all alternative bridges are distinct, and they do not coincide with the main bridges.\n\n\n\nIt is guaranteed that neither the sum of n\n\n nor the sum of m\n\n over all test cases exceeds 2⋅105\n\n.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a binary string of length n−1\n\n on a new line. The i\n\n'th character is 1\n\n if it is possible for Bessie to win if she starts on island i\n\n.

    "content": "**Analysis**\n\nWe have two cows, Bessie and Elsie, racing on a directed acyclic graph of \\(n\\) “islands” (vertices) \\(1,2,\\dots,n\\).  There are two kinds of one‐way edges:\n\n 1. **Main bridges**: for each \\(i=1,2,\\dots,n-1\\) there is an edge \\(i\\to i+1\\).  Bessie may use **only** these main bridges; Elsie may use **both** main bridges and \\(m\\) extra “alternative” bridges \\((u\\to v)\\) with \\(1\\le u<v\\le n\\).\n\n 2. **Alternative bridges**: \\(m\\) arbitrary edges \\(u\\to v\\) (distinct from the main edges), all one‐way and with \\(u<v\\).\n\nBoth cows only move “forward” (to higher‐indexed islands).  They alternate turns, Bessie first.  On her turn, a cow **must** move along one of the outgoing bridges from her current island; immediately after moving, the island she departed collapses (it disappears, and so do all bridges touching it).  If on a cow’s turn there are no outgoing bridges, then that cow is eliminated.  If one cow ever occupies the same island as the other (after that cow’s move), and then the other cow on her very next move leaves that shared island, the collapse of the shared island eliminates the cow who stayed behind.  Finally the race ends as soon as **either** cow reaches island \\(n\\), and Bessie **wins** if and only if she is the first to island \\(n\\).\n\nWe must answer, for **each** starting position \\(s=1,2,\\dots,n-1\\) of Bessie (with Elsie always starting at 1), whether Bessie can force a win, assuming **optimal** play.\n\n---\n\n### 1.  Why one‐way and “collapsing” reduces to a “timing” condition\n\n1.  Because all edges go from lower to higher indices, the underlying directed graph is acyclic.\n\n2.  Bessie’s path is **forced** to be \n\\[\n   s\\;\\to\\;s+1\\;\\to\\;s+2\\;\\to\\;\\cdots\\;\\to\\;n,\n\\]\nusing exactly \\(n-s\\) moves (one per Bessie‐turn).  She has no choice of “skips.”\n\n3.  Elsie’s path can use shortcuts (the alternative bridges), so let us compute the **shortest‐path** distances\n   \\[\n     \\mathrm{dist}_E[i]\\;=\\;\\min\\bigl\\{\\text{number of Elsie‐moves from 1 to }i\\bigr\\}\n   \\]\n   over the combined graph (main \\(+\\) alternative).  In particular \n   \\[\n     L \\;=\\;\\mathrm{dist}_E[n]\n   \\]\n   is the fewest moves Elsie needs to reach \\(n\\).\n\n4.  **If nothing collapsed**, Bessie would win exactly when Bessie’s \\((n-s)\\) th move occurs **no later** than Elsie’s \\(L\\)th move.  Since they alternate (B first), Bessie’s \\(k\\)th move occurs on the \\((2k\\!-\\!1)\\)th overall turn, and Elsie’s \\(L\\)th move on the \\((2L)\\)th turn.  Bessie reaches on turn \\(2(n-s)-1\\); Elsie on turn \\(2L\\).  Bessie beats Elsie iff\n   \\[\n     2(n-s)-1 \\;<\\;2L,\n   \\]\n   i.e. \n   \\[\n     n-s \\;\\le\\; L.\n   \\]\n   Equivalently Elsie would win if \\(L\\le n-s-1\\).\n\n5.  However, each move **collapses** the island just departed, and that can destroy future edges.  \n   In particular when Bessie moves off island \\(j\\) (on her turn) she collapses \\(j\\).  Hence if Elsie ever wanted to use island \\(j\\ge s\\) as an intermediate, she must **arrive there** *before* Bessie collapses it.  \n\n   One checks that Bessie collapses island \\(j\\ge s\\) on her \\((j-s+1)\\)th move, i.e.\\ at overall time\n   \\[\n     T_B(j)\\;=\\;2\\,(j-s+1)\\;-\\;1\\;=\\;2(j-s)+1.\n   \\]\n   Elsie arrives at island \\(j\\) after exactly \\(\\mathrm{dist}_E[j]\\) of her moves, i.e.\\ at time\n   \\[\n     T_E(j)\\;=\\;2\\,\\mathrm{dist}_E[j].\n   \\]\n   To keep \\(j\\) *un*-collapsed when Elsie steps onto it we require\n   \\[\n     T_E(j)\\;<\\;T_B(j)\n     \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad\n     2\\,\\mathrm{dist}_E[j]\\;<\\;2(j-s)+1\n     \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad\n     \\mathrm{dist}_E[j]\\;\\le\\;j-s.\n   \\]\n   If \\(j<s\\), Bessie never collapses \\(j\\), so there is no constraint for \\(j<s\\).\n\n6.  Thus for **every** island \\(j\\) on the route Elsie uses (except 1 initially), if \\(j\\ge s\\) we must have\n   \\[\n     \\mathrm{dist}_E[j]\\;\\le\\;j - s.\n   \\]\n   In particular to actually reach \\(n\\), Elsie’s entire chosen path must obey that “safety” constraint at each intermediary node.\n\n7.  Finally the **winning condition** becomes:\n   \n   “There exists an Elsie‐path from \\(1\\to n\\) of length \\(L\\), using only islands \\(j\\) which satisfy \\(\\mathrm{dist}_E[j]\\le j-s\\) (if \\(j\\ge s\\)), **and** \\(L\\le n-s-1\\).  If so, Elsie can beat Bessie; otherwise Bessie wins.”\n\n8.  We must decide this for every \\(s=1,2,\\dots,n-1\\).  \n\n   -  **Special case** \\(s=1\\).  Both start at island 1.  Bessie moves first, collapses 1 immediately and **eliminates** Elsie outright.  Hence Bessie trivially wins for \\(s=1\\).\n\n   -  For \\(s\\ge2\\), we check existence of a “safe‐and‐short” Elsie path.  If none exists, Bessie wins at \\(s\\).\n\n---\n\n### 2.  Algorithm outline\n\n1.  **Compute \\(\\mathrm{dist}_E[i]\\)** = the fewest Elsie‐moves from 1 to \\(i\\).  This is a simple DP / single‐source shortest paths on a DAG with unit edge‐weights.  We process in increasing order of \\(i\\), keeping\n\n     \\[\n       \\mathrm{dist}_E[1]=0,\n       \\quad\n       \\mathrm{dist}_E[i]\n         =1+\\!\\min\\bigl\\{\\mathrm{dist}_E[i-1]\\bigr\\}\n           \\;\\cup\\;\\bigl\\{\\mathrm{dist}_E[u]\\;\\big|\\;(u\\to i)\\text{ alt}\\bigr\\}.\n     \\]\n\n   Complexity \\(O(n+m)\\).\n\n2.  We now have for each island \\(j\\) its arrival‐time in Elsie‐moves, \\(\\mathrm{dist}_E[j]\\).  \n\n3.  We must test, *for each* \\(s=2..n-1\\), whether there is a path from \\(1\\) to \\(n\\) using only islands \\(j\\) that satisfy\n\n      – if \\(j<s\\), no constraint (always safe),\n      \n      – if \\(j\\ge s\\), must have \\(\\mathrm{dist}_E[j]\\le j-s\\),\n\n   and whether the total path‐length \\(\\le n-s-1\\).\n\n   A **direct** re‐DP for each \\(s\\) would cost \\(O(n+m)\\) each, too big when \\(n\\) up to \\(2\\times10^5\\).\n\n4.  **Key observation** (“sweep‐line in \\(s\\)”)  \n\n   -  Define for each island \\(j\\) an **unsafe** interval of \\(s\\) in which \\(j\\) is disallowed:\n     \n       \\[\n         \\text{unsafe}_j \n         \\;=\\;\\bigl\\{\\,s\\;\\big|\\;2\\le s\\le n-1,\\;\n            j\\ge s,\\;\n            \\mathrm{dist}_E[j]>j-s\n         \\bigr\\}.\n       \\]\n     One checks that this is precisely\n       \\[\n         s\\in\\bigl[\\,\\,(j-\\mathrm{dist}_E[j]+1)\\;,\\;j\\,\\bigr].\n       \\]\n     (When \\(s\\) leaves that interval, either \\(j<s\\) or the inequality \\(\\mathrm{dist}_E[j]\\le j-s\\) holds again.)\n\n   -  As \\(s\\) runs from \\(2\\) to \\(n-1\\), each island \\(j\\) **enters** the forbidden set at \\(s=j-\\mathrm{dist}_E[j]+1\\) and **leaves** it at \\(s=j+1\\).  Thus over all \\(j\\) there are only \\(O(n)\\) “enter/leave” events.\n\n5.  We maintain a data‐structure that **dynamically** keeps track of which vertices are allowed, and recomputes (by a **single** forward‐DAG DP pass) the shortest allowed‐vertex path from \\(1\\to n\\).  We only need to re‐run the DP at those \\(O(n)\\) event-points, not for every single \\(s\\).\n\n6.  Since each DP pass is \\(O(n+m)\\), and there are \\(O(n)\\) events, a naïve “recompute” still would be too big.  **But** in fact one can do an *incremental* DAG‐DP (using a queue of just the vertices whose status changed) and maintain the current best distance to each vertex in **total** \\(O((n+m)\\,\\log n)\\).  \n\n   -  We keep a segment‐tree or a balanced‐BST keyed by the vertex‐index \\(i\\), storing whether \\(i\\) is currently allowed.  \n   -  Whenever an island “enters” or “leaves” the forbidden set, we update that single island’s allowed‐flag in \\(O(\\log n)\\).  \n   -  We also keep a priority‐queue (or multiset) of “those edges \\(u\\to v\\)” whose *cost* \\(\\mathrm{dp}[u]+1\\) might improve \\(\\mathrm{dp}[v]\\); but only if **both** \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) are allowed.  \n   -  One can update distances in total \\(O((n+m)\\log n)\\).\n\n7.  As we march \\(s\\) from \\(2\\) to \\(n-1\\), after processing all “enter/leave” events at that \\(s\\), we read off\n   \\[\n     \\mathrm{dp}_s[n]\\;=\\;\\text{current shortest distance from }1\\to n\\text{ in the allowed sub‐DAG},\n   \\]\n   and compare\n   \\[\n     \\mathrm{dp}_s[n]\\;\\le\\;n-s-1?\n   \\]\n   -  If “yes,” then Elsie can still finish in \\(n-s-1\\) or fewer moves, so **Bessie loses** at \\(s\\) (we write `0`).\n   -  If “no,” then even the best Elsie‐path is too long or impossible, so **Bessie wins** at \\(s\\) (we write `1`).\n\n8.  Finally force the special case \\(s=1\\) to `1` (Bessie wins by collapsing island 1 immediately).\n\nOverall complexity:  \n  – Computing \\(\\mathrm{dist}_E\\) in \\(O(n+m)\\).  \n  – Sorting the \\(2n\\) events in \\(O(n\\log n)\\).  \n  – Maintaining a dynamic DAG‐DP with \\(O(n+m)\\) edge‐updates in total \\(O((n+m)\\log n)\\).  \n  – Output the \\(n-1\\)-bit answer.\n\n---\n\n**Implementation in Java**\n\n```java\nimport java.io.*;\nimport java.util.*;\n\npublic class Main {\n    static final int INF = 1000000007;\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\n        BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));\n        PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(System.out);\n\n        int T = Integer.parseInt(in.readLine());\n        final int MAXNM = 200_000;\n\n        // We'll reuse these arrays across test‐cases (cleared by resizing lists).\n        List<Integer>[] altFrom = new List[MAXNM+5];

We first do a single DAG‐DP pass (cost \\(O(n+m)\\)) to compute  \n   \\[\n     \\mathrm{dist}_E[i]\n     \\;=\\;\\min\\{\\text{Elsie‐moves from 1 to }i\\}.\n   \\]\n2.  An island \\(j\\) becomes **unsafe** for Elsie at any starting‐position \\(s\\) with\n   \\[\n     j\\ge s\n     \\quad\\text{and}\\quad\n     \\mathrm{dist}_E[j] > j-s\n     \\quad\\Longleftrightarrow\\quad\n     s\\in [\\,j-\\mathrm{dist}_E[j]+1\\,,\\,j\\,].\n   \\]\n   We collect two events per \\(j\\):\n   - at \\(s=j-\\mathrm{dist}_E[j]+1\\) we **enter** the forbidden set,  \n   - at \\(s=j+1\\) we **leave** the forbidden set.\n\n3.  We sweep \\(s\\) from \\(2\\) to \\(n-1\\).  We maintain:\n   - an array `forbidCount[j]` (zero ⇒ allowed; positive ⇒ forbidden),\n   - a priority‐queue of *edge‐candidates* \\((u\\!\\to\\!v)\\) giving the number \\(dp[u]+1\\) as a proposal for \\(dp[v]\\),\n   - the usual “lazy‐delete” procedure so that whenever we pop \\((d,v)\\) from the queue,\n     we check that \\(d<dp[v]\\) *and* `forbidCount[v]==0`; if so we update `dp[v]=d` and push its outgoing edges (only if both endpoints remain allowed).\n\n   Because each edge is considered only when its endpoints go from forbidden→allowed, or a real improvement in `dp` occurs, the total number of PQ‐operations is \\(O((n+m)\\log n)\\).\n\n4.  After processing all “enter/leave” events at a given \\(s\\), the array `dp[]` holds the shortest distance in the current allowed‐subgraph from **1** to every vertex.  In particular `dp[n]` is the minimum number of Elsie‐moves to reach \\(n\\) without ever stepping on a vertex that Bessie has already collapsed.  \n\n5.  We compare `dp[n]` with \\((n-s-1)\\).  If\n   \\[\n     \\mathrm{dp}[n]\\;\\le\\;(n-s-1),\n   \\]\n   then Elsie would beat Bessie on move‐count and hence Bessie **loses** (\\(0\\)).  Otherwise Bessie **wins** (\\(1\\)).\n\n6.  Finally we hard‐wire \\(s=1\\) → `1` (Bessie wins by instantly collapsing island 1).\n\nThis meets the \\(O((n+m)\\log n)\\) time bound per test‐case, and since \\(\\sum n, \\sum m\\le 2\\cdot10^5\\) overall, it runs comfortably in time."

    "content": "Here is a single‐block Java solution that runs in \\(O((n+m)\\log m)\\) time per test case, which is more than fast enough for \\(\\sum n,\\sum m\\le2\\cdot10^5\\).  It uses the key observations:\n\n 1.  Compute  \n    distE[i] = Elsie’s shortest distance (in moves) from 1→i,  \n    distR[i] = Elsie’s shortest distance from i→n (by reversing edges and DP).\n\n 2.  For each island \\(j\\), define  \n       \\(A[j]=j-\\mathrm{distE}[j]\\),  \n       so that \\(j\\) is “forbidden” precisely for start‐times  \n       \\(s\\in[L_j,R_j]\\) where  \n         \\(L_j=A[j]+1,\\quad R_j=j.\\)  \n     One checks that these forbidding intervals do not overlap arbitrarily but are “stacked” in increasing \\(j\\), so that at any \\(s\\) the set of forbidden vertices is a single contiguous block \\([\\,low\\ldots high]\\).\n\n 3.  Any Elsie‐path from 1→n that avoids the block \\([low\\ldots high]\\) must either use no vertices in the block (in which case the block is empty) or must “jump over” it in one alternative bridge \\(u\\to v\\) with \\(u<low,\\;v>high\\).  \n     The best such jump has cost  \n       \\(\\min_{u<low<v}\\bigl(\\mathrm{distE}[u]+1+\\mathrm{distR}[v]\\bigr).\\)  \n     If the block is empty, the cost is just \\(\\mathrm{distE}[n].\\)\n\n 4.  We sweep \\(s\\) from \\(2\\) to \\(n-1\\).  As \\(s\\) increases, some \\(j\\) enter the forbidden block (those with \\(L_j=s\\)) and some leave it (those with \\(R_j+1=s\\)).  We maintain `low, high` for the block boundaries, and we maintain a multiset of weights\n       \\(w_{u,v}=\\mathrm{distE}[u]+1+\\mathrm{distR}[v]\\)\n     for all alternative edges \\((u,v)\\) that currently satisfy\n       \\(u<\\text{low}\\)  AND  \\(v>\\text{high}.\\)\n     We can add/remove those edges in \\(O(\\log m)\\) each, because as `low` rises we add all edges whose \\(u\\) newly satisfies \\(u<low\\), and as `high` rises we remove all edges whose \\(v\\) no longer satisfies \\(v>high\\).  A Java `TreeMap<Integer,Integer>` serves as our multiset of weights with quick `firstKey()` for the minimum.\n\n 5.  For each \\(s\\), once we have updated `low,high` and updated the active edge‐multiset, we let  \n     \\[\n       D(s)=\n       \\begin{cases}\n         \\mathrm{distE}[n],&\\text{if the block is empty;}\\\\\n         \\text{(multiset.min)},&\\text{else if nonempty;}\\\\\n         +\\infty,&\\text{else (no valid jump).}\n       \\end{cases}\n     \\]\n     Elsie can beat Bessie (so Bessie loses = ‘0’) exactly when  \n       \\(D(s) \\le n - s - 1\\).  \n     Otherwise Bessie wins = ‘1’.  \n     And we set the special case \\(s=1\\to’1’\\) (Bessie collapses island 1 immediately).\n\nThat yields an \\((n+m)\\log m\\) algorithm overall.\n\n```java\nimport java.io.*;\nimport java.util.*;\n\npublic class Main {\n    static final int INF = 1_000_000_007;\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\n        BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));\n        StringBuilder answer = new StringBuilder();\n        int T = Integer.parseInt(in.readLine());\n        // We will allocate per test-case arrays of size n+5.\n        while (T-- > 0) {\n            StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(in.readLine());\n            int n = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\n            int m = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\n\n            // --- read alternative edges u->v ---\n            List<Integer>[] altFrom = new ArrayList[n+1];\n            List<Integer>[] altTo   = new ArrayList[n+1];\n            for (int i = 1;

If the multiset is empty, that means no single‐hop jump can surmount the block, so `D=INF`.  \n\nFinally, we compare `D` to Bessie’s time `n-s-1`.  If `D<=n-s-1`, Elsie wins (`0`), else Bessie wins (`1`).  \n\nSince each alternative edge is added/removed at most once, and we do \\(O(n)\\) steps, the total work is \\(O((n+m)\\log m)\\).  With \\(\\sum n, \\sum m\\le2\\times10^5\\), this is fast enough in Java."

    "content": "Here is a single‐block Java solution that runs in \\(O((n+m)\\log m)\\) time per test and handles the forbidden‐nodes correctly.  The key fact is that  \n  • \\(L_j = j - \\mathrm{distE}[j] + 1\\) is non‐decreasing in \\(j\\), and \\(R_j=j\\) is increasing,  \nso the set of forbidden islands at a given start‐time \\(s\\) is always a *single* contiguous block  \n\\[\n   F(s)\\;=\\;\\{\\,j\\mid L_j\\le s\\le j\\}\n   \\;=\\;\n   [\\,\\ell=s\\;,\\;h=J(s)\\,],\n\\]\nwhere \\(J(s)\\) is the largest \\(j\\) with \\(L_j\\le s\\).  \n\nWe then maintain a multiset of all alternative‐edge “jump weights”  \n\\[\n   w_{u,v}\\;=\\;\\mathrm{distE}[u]\\;+\\;1\\;+\\;\\mathrm{distR}[v]\n\\]\nfor those alt‐edges \\(u\\to v\\) that *cross* the forbidden block, i.e.\\  \\(u<\\ell\\) and \\(v>h\\).  As \\(s\\) increases from 2 to \\(n-1\\), \\(\\ell\\) and \\(h\\) both move monotonically upwards, so we can add each alt‐edge to the multiset exactly once (when \\(u\\) first becomes \\(<\\ell\\)) and remove it exactly once (when \\(v\\) is swallowed by \\(h\\)).  The minimum in the multiset (or `distE[n]` when the block is empty) is exactly the best Elsie‐path length, and we compare it to \\(n-s-1\\).\n\n```java\nimport java.io.*;\nimport java.util.*;\n\npublic class Main {\n    static final int INF = 1_000_000_000;\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\n        BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));\n        StringBuilder allAns = new StringBuilder();\n        int T = Integer.parseInt(in.readLine());\n        while (T-- > 0) {\n            StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(in.readLine());\n            int n = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\n            int m = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\n\n            // Read alternative edges\n            List<Integer>[] altFrom = new ArrayList[n+1];\n            List<Integer>[] altTo   = new ArrayList[n+1];\n            for (int i = 1;

We compute  \n   distE[i] = shortest Elsie‐moves from 1→i  \n   distR[i] = shortest Elsie‐moves from i→n.  \n\n2. For each island \\(j\\),  \n   \\(L_j = \\max(2,\\,j - \\mathrm{distE}[j] + 1)\\).  \n   Because \\(\\mathrm{distE}[j]\\le \\mathrm{distE}[j-1]+1\\), the sequence \\(L_j\\) is non‐decreasing.  \n\n3. For a given start‐time \\(s\\in[2,n-1]\\), island \\(j\\) is forbidden exactly if \\(L_j\\le s\\le j\\).  Because the intervals \\([L_j,j]\\) have non‐decreasing left and right endpoints, the union of all \\(j\\) with \\(L_j\\le s\\le j\\) is a single contiguous block \\(\\{s,s+1,\\dots, J(s)\\}\\) where \\(J(s)\\) is the largest \\(j\\) with \\(L_j\\le s\\).  \n\n4. Any valid Elsie‐route that avoids that block must “cross” it in one alternative jump \\(u\\to v\\) with \\(u<s\\) and \\(v>J(s)\\), or else go entirely outside (which reduces to the plain DP distance distE[n] if the block is empty).  Thus the best route length is  \n   – distE[n] if \\(s>J(s)\\) (block empty),  \n   – otherwise \\(\\min_{u<s<v>J(s)}\\bigl(\\mathrm{distE}[u]+1+\\mathrm{distR}[v]\\bigr)\\).  \n\n5. We maintain that minimum in a `TreeMap<Integer,Integer>` (a multiset), adding each alt‐edge \\((u,v)\\) exactly once (when \\(u\\) falls below \\(s\\)) and removing it exactly once (when \\(v\\) is swallowed by \\(J(s)\\)).  \n\n6. Finally we compare \\(D(s)\\) to \\(n-s-1\\).  If \\(D(s)\\le n-s-1\\), Elsie can arrive in time ⇒ Bessie loses (‘0’); else Bessie wins (‘1’).  We set the special case \\(s=1\\) to ‘1’ (Bessie immediately collapses island 1).  \n\nSince each edge is added/removed exactly once and each operation on the `TreeMap` costs \\(O(\\log m)\\), the total time per test is \\(O((n+m)\\log m)\\), which is perfectly fine for \\(\\sum n,\\sum m\\le2\\times10^5\\)."
