D. "a" String Problem
time limit per test2 seconds
memory limit per test256 megabytes
You are given a string s
 consisting of lowercase Latin characters. Count the number of nonempty strings t≠
 "a
" such that it is possible to partition†
 s
 into some substrings satisfying the following conditions:

each substring either equals t
 or "a
", and
at least one substring equals t
.
†
 A partition of a string s
 is an ordered sequence of some k
 strings t1,t2,…,tk
 (called substrings) such that t1+t2+…+tk=s
, where +
 represents the concatenation operation.

Input
The first line contains a single integer t
 (1≤t≤104
) — the number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s
 consisting of lowercase Latin characters (2≤|s|≤2⋅105
).

The sum of |s|
 over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅105
.

Output
For each test case, output a single integer — the number of nonempty strings t≠
 "a
" that satisfy all constraints.

Note
In the first test case, t
 can be "aa
", "aaa
", "aaaa
", or the full string.

In the second test case, t
 can be "b
", "bab
", "ba
", or the full string.

In the third test case, the only such t
 is the full string.
