In the three versions, the constraints on n\n\n and m\n\n are different. You can make hacks only if all the versions of the problem are solved.\n\n\n\nPak Chanek is setting up internet connections for the village of Khuntien. The village can be represented as a connected simple graph with n\n\n houses and m\n\n internet cables connecting house ui\n\n and house vi\n\n, each with a latency of wi\n\n.\n\n\n\nThere are p\n\n houses that require internet. Pak Chanek can install servers in at most k\n\n of the houses. The houses that need internet will then be connected to one of the servers. However, since each cable has its latency, the latency experienced by house si\n\n requiring internet will be the maximum latency of the cables between that house and the server it is connected to.\n\n\n\nFor each k=1,2,…,n\n\n, help Pak Chanek determine the minimum total latency that can be achieved for all the houses requiring internet.\n\n\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t\n\n (1≤t≤100\n\n). The description of the test cases follows.\n\n\n\nThe first line of each test case contains three integers n\n\n, m\n\n, p\n\n (2≤n≤400\n\n; n−1≤m≤400\n\n; 1≤p≤n\n\n) — the number of houses, the number of cables and the number of houses that need internet.\n\n\n\nThe second line of each test case contains p\n\n integers s1,s2,…,sp\n\n (1≤si≤n\n\n) — the houses that need internet. It is guaranteed that all elements of s\n\n are distinct.\n\n\n\nThe i\n\n-th of the next m\n\n lines of each test case contains three integers ui\n\n, vi\n\n, and wi\n\n (1≤ui<vi≤n\n\n; 1≤wi≤109\n\n) — the internet cable connecting house ui\n\n and house vi\n\n with latency of wi\n\n. It is guaranteed that the given edges form a connected simple graph.\n\n\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n3\n\n and the sum of m3\n\n do not exceed 108\n\n.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output n\n\n integers: the minimum total latency that can be achieved for all the houses requiring internet for each k=1,2,…,n\n\n.\n\n\n\nExample\n\nInputCopy\n\n2\n\n9 8 5\n\n2 5 6 8 9\n\n1 2 1\n\n1 3 2\n\n3 4 10\n\n4 5 3\n\n4 6 5\n\n1 7 10\n\n7 8 4\n\n7 9 2\n\n3 3 2\n\n3 1\n\n1 2 1\n\n2 3 3\n\n1 3 2\n\nOutputCopy\n\n34 19 9 4 0 0 0 0 0\n\n2 0 0\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case for k=3\n\n, a possible optimal solution is to install servers at vertices 2\n\n, 6\n\n and 8\n\n and obtain the following latency:\n\n\n\nlatency(2)=0\n\nlatency(5)=max(3,5)=5\n\nlatency(6)=0\n\nlatency(8)=0\n\nlatency(9)=max(2,4)=4\n\nSo the total latency is 9\n\n.\n\n---\n\nYou are a competitive programming assistant solving Codeforces problems using Java. First, carefully read and restate the problem in your own words to ensure full understanding. Identify the input and output formats, list the constraints, and consider any edge cases that might affect the logic. Next, determine which algorithmic pattern the problem fits best—such as greedy, binary search, two pointers, dynamic programming, or graph traversal—and briefly explain why that pattern applies. Then, plan your solution step by step, describing the key ideas, data structures, or mathematical insights you’ll use. Once your plan is clear, write a clean and fully working Java program. Use import java.util.*; and include a Main class with a main method, using Scanner or BufferedReader for input depending on the constraints. Add comments to explain important logic in the code. After coding, walk through a sample input manually to show how your solution works in practice. Finally, analyze the time and space complexity of your approach using Big-O notation, justifying your answer. Think step by step and only write code once the logic is sound and complete."

Then each special house \\\\(s_i\\\\) will connect to whichever server gives the smallest _bottleneck_ path latency, where the latency of a path is defined as the maximum edge‐weight on that path.

Hence we may first build an MST of the graph and then ignore the other edges.\\n\\n2. **Kruskal‐reconstruction tree**  \\n   If we run Kruskal's algorithm on the MST edges in increasing order of weight, each time we union two components we can create a new internal tree‐node whose weight is the edge’s weight, and whose two children are the roots of the two components being merged.  This builds a binary tree of size \\\\(2n-1\\\\): the original \\\\(n\\\\) vertices become the leaves (with weight \\\\(0\\\\)), and there are \\\\(n-1\\\\) internal nodes each labeled by the edge‐weight that merged two parts.  In this tree, the LCA of two original leaves has weight equal to the max‐edge on the MST‐path between them.\\n\\n3. **Dynamic‐programming on that tree**  \\n   Suppose we place \\\\(j\\\\) centers among the leaves of a subtree.  We want to know the minimum sum of bottleneck‐distances by which that subtree’s special leaves are covered (some might remain “uncovered” if \\\\(j=0\\\\), to be covered higher up).  It turns out (by monotonicity of covering) that in each subtree you never leave any special leaf “uncovered” if you have at least one center in that subtree—covering it immediately can only help.  Hence:\\n\\n   - Let \\\\(S[u]\\\\) = number of special leaves in the subtree rooted at node \\\\(u\\\\).  \\n   - Let \\\\(f[u][j]\\\\) = minimum total cost to _cover all_ \\\\(S[u]\\\\) special leaves using exactly \\\\(j\\\\) centers in that subtree (for \\\\(j\\\\le S[u]\\\\)).  \\n\\n   If \\\\(u\\\\) is a leaf:\\n   - If it is special, \\\\(S[u]=1\\\\).

Since \\\\(\\\\sum n^3,m^3\\\\le10^8\\\\), it fits in 2 s.\\n\\nThis solves the **easy version** (with \\\\(n,m\\\\le400\\\\)) exactly.\",\n        \"refusal\": null,\n        \"role\": \"assistant\",\n        \"annotations\": [],\n        \"audio\": null,\n        \"function_call\": null,\n        \"tool_calls\": null\n      },\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"protected_material_code\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": true,\n          \"citation\": {\n            \"URL\": \"https://github.com/ashishk4oct/Workspace/tree/fc9bf241dcfbd6bcbce017046c49a8aa06f477b8/GeeksForGeeks%2Fsrc%2Fcom%2Fcodechef%2Feasy%2FConservativeGraphOptimalSolution.java\",\n            \"license\": \"NOASSERTION\"\n          }\n        },\n        \"protected_material_text\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"created\": 1753326847,\n  \"model\": \"o4-mini-2025-04-16\",\n  \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n  \"service_tier\": null,\n  \"system_fingerprint\": null,\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"completion_tokens\": 19365,\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 959,\n    \"total_tokens\": 20324,\n    \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n      \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"reasoning_tokens\": 16000,\n      \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n    },\n    \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"cached_tokens\": 0\n    }\n  },\n  \"prompt_filter_results\": [\n    {\n      \"prompt_index\": 0,\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"jailbreak\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
