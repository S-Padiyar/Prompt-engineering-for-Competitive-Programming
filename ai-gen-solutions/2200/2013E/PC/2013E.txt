You are given an array of positive integer numbers a1,a2,…,an
. The elements of the array can be rearranged in any order. You need to find the smallest possible value of the expression
gcd(a1)+gcd(a1,a2)+…+gcd(a1,a2,…,an),
where gcd(a1,a2,…,an)
 denotes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a1,a2,…,an
.

Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t
 (1≤t≤104
). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single number n
 (1≤n≤105
) — the size of the array.

The second line of each test case contains n
 numbers a1,a2,…,an
 (1≤ai≤105
) — the initial array.

The sum of n
 over all test cases does not exceed 105
.

The sum of max(a1,a2,…,an)
 over all test cases does not exceed 105
.

Output
For each test case, output a single number on a separate line — the answer to the problem.

Note
In the first test case, the elements can be rearranged as follows: [2,4,2]
. Then the answer will be gcd(2)+gcd(2,4)+gcd(2,4,2)=2+2+2=6
.

In the third test case, the elements can be rearranged as follows: [6,10,15]
. Then the answer will be gcd(6)+gcd(6,10)+gcd(6,10,15)=6+2+1=9
