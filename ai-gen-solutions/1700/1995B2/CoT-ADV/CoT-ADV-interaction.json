The only difference is that in this version, instead of listing the number of petals for each flower, the number of petals and the quantity of flowers in the store is set for all types of flowers.\n\n\n\nA girl is preparing for her birthday and wants to buy the most beautiful bouquet. There are a total of n\n\n different types of flowers in the store, each of which is characterized by the number of petals and the quantity of this type of flower. A flower with k\n\n petals costs k\n\n coins. The girl has decided that the difference in the number of petals between any two flowers she will use to decorate her cake should not exceed one. At the same time, the girl wants to assemble a bouquet with the maximum possible number of petals. Unfortunately, she only has m\n\n coins, and she cannot spend more. What is the maximum total number of petals she can assemble in the bouquet?\n\n\n\nInput\n\nEach test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single integer t\n\n (1≤t≤10000\n\n) — the number of test cases. This is followed by descriptions of the test cases.\n\n\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers n\n\n, m\n\n (1≤n≤2⋅105,1≤m≤1018\n\n) — the number of types of flowers in the store and the number of coins the girl possesses, respectively. The second line of each test case contains n\n\n different integers a1,a2,…,an\n\n (1≤ai≤109\n\n), where ai\n\n is the number of petals of the i\n\n-th flower type in the store (for different indexes i≠j\n\n, it must be ai≠aj\n\n). The third line of each test case contains n\n\n integers c1,c2,…,cn\n\n (1≤ci≤109\n\n), where ci\n\n is the quantity of the i\n\n-th flower type in the store.\n\n\n\nThe sum of n\n\n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105\n\n.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print one integer — the maximum possible number of petals in a bouquet that a girl can collect, observing all the conditions listed above.\n\n\n\nExample\n\nInputCopy\n\n7\n\n3 10\n\n1 2 3\n\n2 2 1\n\n3 1033\n\n206 207 1000\n\n3 4 1\n\n6 20\n\n4 2 7 5 6 1\n\n1 2 1 3 1 7\n\n8 100000\n\n239 30 610 122 24 40 8 2\n\n12 13123 112 1456 124 100 123 10982\n\n6 13\n\n2 4 11 1 3 5\n\n2 2 1 2 2 1\n\n8 10330\n\n206 210 200 201 198 199 222 1000\n\n9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16\n\n2 10000000000\n\n11 12\n\n87312315 753297050\n\nOutputCopy\n\n7\n\n1033\n\n19\n\n99990\n\n13\n\n10000\n\n9999999999\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, some valid bouquets are (1,1,2,2),(2,2,3),(1,1),(2,2)\n\n. The maximum over all valid bouquets not greater than 10\n\n is 7\n\n for (2,2,3)\n\n. In the second test case, you can assemble a valid bouquet with (206,206,207,207,207)\n\n with a sum of 1033\n\n, which is the maximum number of petals the girl can buy. In the third test case, you can assemble a valid bouquet with (5,5,5,4)\n\n with a sum of 19\n\n. It can be seen that no valid bouquet can have 20\n\n petals.\n\n---\n\nYou are a competitive programming assistant solving Codeforces problems using Java. First, carefully read and restate the problem in your own words to ensure full understanding. Identify the input and output formats, list the constraints, and consider any edge cases that might affect the logic. Next, determine which algorithmic pattern the problem fits best—such as greedy, binary search, two pointers, dynamic programming, or graph traversal—and briefly explain why that pattern applies. Then, plan your solution step by step, describing the key ideas, data structures, or mathematical insights you’ll use. Once your plan is clear, write a clean and fully working Java program. Use import java.util.*; and include a Main class with a main method, using Scanner or BufferedReader for input depending on the constraints. Add comments to explain important logic in the code. After coding, walk through a sample input manually to show how your solution works in practice. Finally, analyze the time and space complexity of your approach using Big-O notation, justifying your answer. Think step by step and only write code once the logic is sound and complete."
