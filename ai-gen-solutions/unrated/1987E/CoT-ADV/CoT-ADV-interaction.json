First, carefully read and restate the problem in your own words to ensure full understanding. Identify the input and output formats, list the constraints, and consider any edge cases that might affect the logic. Next, determine which algorithmic pattern the problem fits best—such as greedy, binary search, two pointers, dynamic programming, or graph traversal—and briefly explain why that pattern applies. Then, plan your solution step by step, describing the key ideas, data structures, or mathematical insights you’ll use. Once your plan is clear, write a clean and fully working Java program. Use import java.util.*; and include a Main class with a main method, using Scanner or BufferedReader for input depending on the constraints. Add comments to explain important logic in the code. After coding, walk through a sample input manually to show how your solution works in practice. Finally, analyze the time and space complexity of your approach using Big-O notation, justifying your answer. Think step by step and only write code once the logic is sound and complete."

Each vertex v has an integer value a_v written on it.  We call the tree *wonderful* if, for every non‐leaf vertex v,  \\n```\\na_v  ≤  ∑_{u child of v} a_u.\\n```\\nIn one operation, we may pick any vertex v and increase its a_v by 1.  We want the minimum number of operations to make the given tree wonderful.\\n\\n**Input**\\n\\nt (number of test cases)  \\nFor each test case:  \\n  n  \\n  a_1 a_2 … a_n  \\n  p_2 p_3 … p_n  (each p_i < i, gives the parent of i)\\n\\n**Output**\\n\\nFor each test case, print the minimum number of operations needed.\\n\\nConstraints:\\n- 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000  \\n- 2 ≤ n ≤ 5000  \\n- 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9  \\n- sum of n over all test cases ≤ 5000\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Key Observation and Algorithm**\\n\\n1.  **Where to put your +1 increments?**  \\n    - An increment on a node v directly increases a_v by 1.  That helps satisfy the constraint at v’s *parent* if v is a child of that parent.  But if we ever need to propagate an increase further up (grandparent, etc.), we must also increment the parent itself (and then repair its own children‐sum constraint), and so on.  \\n    - Thus, each node v has a *cost* `cost[v]` = minimum number of single‐increments needed to raise a_v by 1 while still maintaining the wonderful‐constraint *in v’s entire subtree*.  Leaves have `cost[leaf] = 1` (just do one operation on the leaf).  Internal nodes might have `cost[v] > 1` if raising a_v forces us to first increase its children.\\n\\n2.  **DFS bottom‐up**  \\n    We do a post‐order DFS.  For each node v:\\n    - First solve all children u, so we know:\\n      - `ops[u]` = minimum operations to make *u’s subtree* wonderful (and put a_u into a stable state).\\n      - `cost[u]` = cost to bump a_u by +1 thereafter.\\n      - `a[u]` will be its final value after we repaired its subtree.\\n    - Sum up  \\n      ```\\n      sumOps = ∑ ops[u]\\n      S = ∑ a[u]       (the sum of child‐values)\\n      ```\\n    - If S < a[v], we have to raise S up to a[v].  Each unit increase of S means we raise *some* child u by +1; doing that costs `cost[u]`.  To minimize, pick the child with smallest `cost[u]`, call that `minCost`, and do \\n      ```\\n      deficit = a[v] - S\\n      sumOps += deficit * minCost\\n      // simulate raising that child by 'deficit':\\n      a[bestChild] += deficit\\n      S += deficit\\n      ```\\n      (This ensures `a[v] ≤ S`.)\\n    - Now the subtree of v is wonderful, and `ops[v] = sumOps`.\\n    - Finally we compute `cost[v]`, i.e. how many more ops it would cost us to do one more +1 on a[v] later:\\n      - After fixing, the surplus on v is `surplus = S - a[v]`.\\n      - If `surplus ≥ 1`, we can do +1 on v at cost 1 (we’ll still have `surplus-1 ≥ 0`).  \\n      - Otherwise (`surplus == 0`), raising a[v] by 1 forces us to push +1 again into children, so  \\n        `cost[v] = 1 + minCost`.\\n\\n3.  **Answer**  \\n   After doing DFS(1), `ops[1]` is the total minimal operations.\\n\\nThis runs in O(n) per test (we visit each node once, summing over children).  n ≤ 5000 total across all tests, easily fits 2 sec.\\n\\n---\\n\\n```java\\nimport java.io.*;\\nimport java.util.*;\\n\\npublic class Main {\\n    static int n;\\n    static long[] a;            // a[v] will be updated to its \\\"fixed\\\" value\\n    static long[] ops;          // ops[v] = min operations to fix subtree v\\n    static long[] cost;         // cost[v] = cost to raise a[v] by +1 after fixing its subtree\\n    static List<Integer>[] children;\\n\\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\\n        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));\\n        StringTokenizer st;\\n\\n        int t = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine().trim());\\n        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\\n\\n        while (t-- > 0) {\\n            n = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine().trim());\\n            a = new long[n+1];\\n            ops = new long[n+1];\\n            cost = new long[n+1];\\n            children = new ArrayList[n+1];\\n            for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\\n                children[i] = new ArrayList<>();\\n            }\\n\\n            // Read the a[i]\\n            st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\\n            for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\\n                a[i] = Long.parseLong(st.nextToken());\\n            }\\n\\n            // Read parents p[2..n], build child lists\\n            st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\\n            for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {\\n                int p = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\\n                children[p].add(i);\\n            }\\n\\n            // Run DFS from root = 1\\n            dfs(1);\\n\\n            // The answer is ops[1]\\n            sb.append(ops[1]).append('\\\\n');\\n        }\\n\\n        System.out.print(sb.toString());\\n    }\\n\\n    // Post-order DFS: fix the subtree under v, compute ops[v] & cost[v]\\n    static void dfs(int v) {\\n        // If v is a leaf, no child‐constraint to fix\\n        if (children[v].isEmpty()) {\\n            ops[v] = 0;\\n            cost[v] = 1;  // raising a[v] by 1 just costs 1 op\\n            return;\\n        }\\n\\n        long sumOps = 0;       // total ops in all child subtrees\\n        long S = 0;            // sum of child a[u]\\n        long minCost = Long.MAX_VALUE;\\n        int bestChild = -1;\\n\\n        // First, solve children\\n        for (int u : children[v]) {\\n            dfs(u);\\n            sumOps += ops[u];\\n            S += a[u];\\n            if (cost[u] < minCost) {\\n                minCost = cost[u];\\n                bestChild = u;\\n            }\\n        }\\n\\n        // If children's sum S < a[v], we must push 'deficit' units into children\\n        if (S < a[v]) {\\n            long deficit = a[v] - S;\\n            // We will always push into the child of smallest cost\\n            sumOps += deficit * minCost;\\n            // simulate raising that child's value\\n            a[bestChild] += deficit;\\n            S += deficit;\\n        }\\n\\n        // Now the local constraint a[v] <= S is satisfied\\n        ops[v] = sumOps;\\n\\n        // Compute cost[v]: cost to raise a[v] by +1 later\\n        long surplus = S - a[v];\\n        if (surplus >= 1) {\\n            // We have slack, so a single '+1 at v' costs exactly 1\\n            cost[v] = 1;\\n        } else {\\n            // No slack; raising a[v] by 1 will force one unit into children first\\n            cost[v] = 1 + minCost;\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**How it works on a small example**\\n\\nConsider the sample  \\n```\\nn=5\\na = [9,3,4,1,2]\\nedges: 1→2, 1→3, 3→4, 3→5\\n```\\nTree:\\n\\n```\\n      (1:9)\\n     /     \\\\\\n   (2:3)  (3:4)\\n         /   \\\\\\n       (4:1) (5:2)\\n```\\n\\nDFS bottom‐up:\\n\\n- Node 2 and 4 and 5 are leaves.  \\n  - ops[2]=ops[4]=ops[5]=0, cost[2]=cost[4]=cost[5]=1.\\n\\n- Node 3 has children 4,5  \\n  - sumOps=0, S=1+2=3, minCost=1  \\n  - But a[3]=4 so S<4 ⇒ deficit=1 ⇒ sumOps+=1×1=1, a[5]+=1 ⇒ a[5]=3, S=4  \\n  - ops[3]=1.
