This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference is that x=n
 in this version. You must solve both versions to be able to hack.

You are given two integers n
 and x
 (x=n
). There are n
 balls lined up in a row, numbered from 1
 to n
 from left to right. Initially, there is a value ai
 written on the i
-th ball.

For each integer i
 from 1
 to n
, we define a function f(i)
 as follows:

Suppose you have a set S={1,2,…,i}
.

In each operation, you have to select an integer l
 (1≤l<i
) from S
 such that l
 is not the largest element of S
. Suppose r
 is the smallest element in S
 which is greater than l
.

If al>ar
, you set al=al+ar
 and remove r
 from S
.
If al<ar
, you set ar=al+ar
 and remove l
 from S
.
If al=ar
, you choose either the integer l
 or r
 to remove from S
:
If you choose to remove l
 from S
, you set ar=al+ar
 and remove l
 from S
.
If you choose to remove r
 from S
, you set al=al+ar
 and remove r
 from S
.

f(i)
 denotes the number of integers j
 (1≤j≤i
) such that it is possible to obtain S={j}
 after performing the above operations exactly i−1
 times.
For each integer i
 from x
 to n
, you need to find f(i)
.

Input
The first line contains t
 (1≤t≤104
) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n
 and x
 (1≤n≤2⋅105;x=n
) — the number of balls and the smallest index i
 for which you need to find f(i)
.

The second line of each test case contains a1,a2,…,an
 (1≤ai≤109
) — the initial number written on each ball.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n
 over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105
.

Output
For each test case, output n−x+1
 space separated integers on a new line, where the j
-th integer should represent f(x+j−1)

Note
In the first test case, you are required to calculate f(5)
. It can be shown that after 4
 operations, S
 can contain 2
, 3
, or 4
. The following shows the operations required to make S={4}
.

Initially, S={1,2,3,4,5}
 and a=[1,2,3,2,1]
.
Choose l=1
. Naturally, r=2
. Since a1<a2
, we set a2=1+2
 and remove 1
 from S
. Now, S={2,3,4,5}
 and a=[1,3,3,2,1]
.
Choose l=4
. Naturally, r=5
. Since a4>a5
, we set a4=2+1
 and remove 5
 from S
. Now, S={2,3,4}
 and a=[1,3,3,3,1]
.
Choose l=3
. Naturally, r=4
. Since a3=a4
, we have a choice whether to remove 3
 or 4
. Since we want to preserve 4
, let's remove 3
. So, set a4=3+3
 and remove 3
 from S
. Now, S={2,4}
 and a=[1,3,3,6,1]
.
Choose l=2
. Naturally, r=4
. Since a2<a4
, we set a4=3+6
 and remove 2
 from S
. Finally, S={4}
 and a=[1,3,3,9,1]
.
In the second test case, you are required to calculate f(7)
. It can be shown that after 6
 operations, S
 can contain 2
, 4
, 6
, or 7
.
