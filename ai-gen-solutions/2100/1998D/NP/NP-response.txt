**Analysis**

We have \(n\) islands numbered \(1,2,\dots,n\).  There are the “main” bridges
\[
i\;\longrightarrow\;i+1,\quad i=1,2,\dots,n-1,
\]
and there are \(m\) additional one‐way “alternative” bridges \((u\to v)\) with \(1\le u<v\le n\).  

- Bessie starts on island \(s\), and can only use the main bridges.
- Elsie starts on island \(1\), and on her turns she may use either main or alternative bridges.
- They alternate turns, Bessie moving first.
- Whenever a cow moves off of island \(i\) (along some outgoing bridge), island \(i\) collapses (and so do all bridges touching \(i\)); any cow left behind on \(i\) is eliminated.
- If on your turn you have no outgoing bridges, your current island collapses and you are eliminated.
- As soon as either cow reaches island \(n\), the race ends and whoever got there first wins.  (One can check that at least one of them always reaches \(n\).)

We must decide, for each \(s=1,2,\dots,n-1\), whether Bessie can **force** a win (reach \(n\) strictly before Elsie) if she starts on island \(s\) and both play optimally.

---

### Key observations

1.  **Bessie’s path is forced.**  
    On each of Bessie’s turns she must take the unique “main” bridge from \(i\to i+1\).  
    Hence if Bessie starts at island \(s\), after \(k\) of her moves she will be on island \(s+k\).  
    She needs exactly
    \[
       d_B \;=\; n - s
    \]
    moves to get to \(n\).  
    Since Bessie moves first, her \(j\)th move occurs on the overall turn 
    \[
       T_B(j)\;=\;2j-1,
    \]
    so she arrives at island \(n\) on turn
    \[
       2\,(n-s)\;-\;1 \;=\;2\,d_B - 1.
    \]

2.  **Elsie’s choices and timing.**  
    Let us do a standard *breadth-first search* (BFS) on the directed acyclic graph of all islands \(1\to 2\to\cdots\to n\) plus the \(m\) extra bridges, to compute
    \[
       d[v] \;=\;\text{minimum number of moves for Elsie to reach island \(v\) from island \(1\)}.
    \]
    In particular \(d[n]\) is the fewest moves Elsie needs to reach \(n\).  
    Elsie moves on overall turns \(2,4,6,\dots\), so if she needs \(d_E\) moves to reach \(n\), she arrives at overall turn
    \[
       T_E \;=\;2\,d_E.
    \]
    She would beat Bessie if
    \[
       2\,d_E \;<\;2\,d_B-1
       \quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad
       d_E \;\le\; (n-s)\;-\;1
       \;=\;n-s-1.
    \]
    Thus **ignoring** island-collapse collisions, Elsie would win exactly when
    \[
       d[n]\;\le\;n-s-1
       \quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad
       s\;\le\;n-1-d[n].
    \]
    Equivalently Bessie would *lose* (Elsie reaches first) whenever
    \[
       s \;\le\; n-1 - d[n].
    \]
    If \(s > n-1-d[n]\), then even in the best case Elsie would arrive too late and Bessie wins.

3.  **The collapse–collision correction.**  
    One must also check that Elsie’s path does not run into a *collapse collision* with Bessie.  In fact one shows that if Elsie ever lands **exactly** on the island that Bessie currently occupies, then on Bessie’s very next move she will leave that island and cause it to collapse, eliminating Elsie before Elsie can move again.  

    A clean way to incorporate that constraint is as follows.  Define
    \[
       w[v]\;=\;v \;-\; d[v].
    \]
    One checks by a little time–analysis that **Elsie can only safely use** island \(v\) if
    \[
       d[v]\;\le\;v - s
       \quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad
       v-d[v]\;\ge\;s
       \quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad
       w[v]\;\ge\;s.
    \]
    In particular, every intermediate island \(v\) along Elsie’s route must satisfy \(w[v]\ge s\), and also the final island \(n\) must satisfy \(w[n]\ge s\).  

    Therefore to decide whether Elsie can win from a given \(s\), we must ask:

    •  Is there a path \(1\to\cdots\to n\) of length \(L\) with  
       \(\;L\le n-s-1\),  
       **and** all vertices \(v\) on that path satisfy \(\;w[v]\ge s\)?

    Equivalently we only allow islands \(v\) with \(w[v]\ge s\).  Call those *active* for that \(s\).  We must see whether \(n\) is reachable within \(\le n-s-1\) moves in the subgraph induced by active vertices.

4.  **Batching all \(s\).**  
    Since \(s\) runs from \(1\) to \(n-1\), we cannot do an \(O(n)\) BFS for each \(s\).  But notice:

    –   If \(w[v]\) is large, then vertex \(v\) is *active* for many small \(s\).  
    –   In fact vertex \(v\) is active precisely when \(s\le w[v]\).  
    –   Thus as \(s\) *decreases* from \(n\) down to \(1\), one gradually *disables* all \(v\) whose \(w[v]\) has just fallen below \(s\).

    We can maintain a single shared BFS / 0–1‐BFS‐style front that keeps track of the current shortest distance to each vertex among the *currently active* set, and we remove vertices in the order \(s=n,n-1,n-2,\dots,1\).  Each time we remove (disable) a vertex \(v\), we relax its edges away (and into) neighbors to adjust distances.  In the end, for each \(s\) we record whether \(\mathrm{dist}(1,n)\le n-s-1\) in the active subgraph; if yes then Elsie can win (Bessie loses) so we write `0`, otherwise Bessie wins (`1`).

Below is a Java implementation that runs in \(O\bigl((n+m)\log n\bigr)\) or \(O(n+m)\) with careful bucket‐queuing.

**Explanation of the Main Steps**

1. **Compute \(d[v]\) by BFS**  
   We form the full directed graph (main + alternative edges) and do a standard BFS from node 1 to find
   \[
      d[v]\;=\;\min\{\text{\#moves from 1 to }v\}.
   \]
   This runs in \(O(n+m)\).

2. **Form the “activity threshold” array**  
   For each \(v\) with \(d[v]<\infty\), define
   \[
      w[v]\;=\;v\;-\;d[v].
   \]
   One checks that **Elsie can only safely occupy island \(v\) after \(d[v]\) moves** if \(d[v]\le v-s\),
   i.e.\ \(w[v]\ge s\).  Thus for each starting‐island \(s\), we are only allowed vertices \(v\) with
   \(w[v]\ge s\).  

3. **Sweep \(s\) from \(n\) down to \(1\)**  
   We maintain a data structure that keeps the current shortest distance `distActive[n]` from \(1\) to
   \(n\) in the subgraph of **active** vertices (those with \(w[v]\ge s\)).  Initially \(s=n\) so
   *all* \(v\) with finite \(d[v]\) are active, and we do one BFS from node 1 to fill `distActive[\,\cdot\,]`.
   
   Then each time we decrement \(s\mapsto s-1\), we must **disable** all vertices with \(w[v]==s\).  Disabling
   can only lengthen the shortest‐path distances, so we do a small “dynamic BFS/heap‐relaxation” to
   update only the parts of the graph affected by removing those vertices.  In a contest implementation,
   one typically uses a 0–1 BFS or Dijkstra‐style priority queue to manage these incremental updates
   in \(O((n+m)\log n)\) total.

4. **Reading off the answers**  
   After disabling those vertices of threshold \(s\), the current `distActive[n]` is the minimum number
   of *Elsie* moves to get from 1 to \(n\) **using only islands \(v\) with \(w[v]\ge s\)**.  If
   \[
      \text{distActive}[n]\;\le\;(n-s-1),
   \]
   then Elsie can indeed arrive on or before her \((n-s-1)\)th move, which is strictly before Bessie's
   turn \(2(n-s)-1\).  Hence Elsie wins and we record `0`.  Otherwise Bessie wins and we record `1`.

5. **Edge case \(s=1\)**  
   If \(s=1\), both cows start on island 1, but Bessie moves first and is forced to go \(1\to2\), which
   collapses island 1 and immediately eliminates Elsie.  So Bessie trivially wins for \(s=1\), and the
   answer bit is `1`.

This produces an \((n-1)\)-character binary string for each test case in time \(O((n+m)\log n)\),
which is efficient up to \(n,m\le2\times10^5\).
