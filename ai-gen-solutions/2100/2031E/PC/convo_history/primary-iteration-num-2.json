Penchick and Chloe's Trees\n\ntime limit per test3.5 seconds\n\nmemory limit per test512 megabytes\n\n\n\nWith just a few hours left until Penchick and Chloe leave for Singapore, they could hardly wait to see the towering trees at the Singapore Botanic Gardens! Attempting to contain their excitement, Penchick crafted a rooted tree to keep Chloe and himself busy.\n\n\n\nPenchick has a rooted tree∗\n\n consisting of n\n\n vertices, numbered from 1\n\n to n\n\n, with vertex 1\n\n as the root, and Chloe can select a non-negative integer d\n\n to create a perfect binary tree†\n\n of depth d\n\n.\n\n\n\nSince Penchick and Chloe are good friends, Chloe wants her tree to be isomorphic‡\n\n to Penchick's tree. To meet this condition, Chloe can perform the following operation on her own tree any number of times:\n\n\n\nSelect an edge (u,v)\n\n, where u\n\n is the parent of v\n\n.\n\nRemove vertex v\n\n and all the edges connected to v\n\n, then connect all of v\n\n's previous children directly to u\n\n.\n\nIn particular, doing an operation on an edge (u,v)\n\n where v\n\n is a leaf will delete vertex v\n\n without adding any new edges.\n\n\n\nSince constructing a perfect binary tree can be time-consuming, Chloe wants to choose the minimum d\n\n such that a perfect binary tree of depth d\n\n can be made isomorphic to Penchick's tree using the above operation. Note that she can't change the roots of the trees.\n\n\n\n∗\n\nA tree is a connected graph without cycles. A rooted tree is a tree where one vertex is special and called the root. The parent of vertex v\n\n is the first vertex on the simple path from v\n\n to the root. The root has no parent. A child of vertex v\n\n is any vertex u\n\n for which v\n\n is the parent. A leaf is any vertex without children.\n\n\n\n†\n\nA full binary tree is rooted tree, in which each node has 0\n\n or 2\n\n children. A perfect binary tree is a full binary tree in which every leaf is at the same distance from the root. The depth of such a tree is the distance from the root to a leaf.\n\n\n\n‡\n\nTwo rooted trees, rooted at r1\n\n and r2\n\n respectively, are considered isomorphic if there exists a permutation p\n\n of the vertices such that an edge (u,v)\n\n exists in the first tree if and only if the edge (pu,pv)\n\n exists in the second tree, and pr1=r2\n\n.\n\n\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t\n\n (1≤t≤105\n\n). The description of the test cases follows.\n\n\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer n\n\n (2≤n≤106\n\n) — the number of vertices in Penchick's tree.\n\n\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n−1\n\n integers p2,p3,…,pn\n\n (1≤pi≤i−1\n\n) — the parent of vertex i\n\n.\n\n\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n\n\n over all test cases does not exceed 106\n\n.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single integer on each line: the minimum depth of Chloe's perfect binary tree.\n\n\n\nExample\n\nInputCopy\n\n5\n\n6\n\n1 2 2 1 1\n\n15\n\n1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 5 6 6 7 7\n\n5\n\n1 2 2 2\n\n7\n\n1 1 2 1 1 2\n\n10\n\n1 1 1 2 2 2 4 3 3\n\nOutputCopy\n\n2\n\n3\n\n3\n\n3\n\n3\n\nNote\n\nFor the first test case, create a perfect binary tree with depth 2\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider carrying out the operation on edge AC\n\n. Then the edges AC\n\n, CF\n\n, and CG\n\n are removed, and edges AF\n\n and AG\n\n are added.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe resulting tree is isomorphic to the tree given in the input. It can be proven that no sequence of operations carried out on a binary tree of depth less than 2\n\n can lead to a tree isomorphic to the tree given in the input.\n\n\n\nIn the second test case, the tree is already isomorphic to a perfect binary tree of depth 3\n\n.\n\nUse Java."

    "content": "**Analysis**\n\nWe have two kinds of trees:\n\n 1. Penchick’s given rooted tree \\(T\\) with \\(n\\) vertices (rooted at 1).  \n 2. Chloe’s initial tree: a *perfect binary tree* of some depth \\(d\\).  Recall that a perfect binary tree of depth \\(d\\) has exactly \\(2^d\\) leaves and each internal node has exactly 2 children, and all leaves are at the same distance \\(d\\) from the root.\n\nChloe is allowed to perform *contraction* operations on her perfect tree:  \n  - Pick an edge \\((u,v)\\) with \\(u\\) the parent of \\(v\\).  \n  - Delete \\(v\\) (and its incident edges), and re-attach all of \\(v\\)’s children directly under \\(u\\).  \n  - In effect, whenever one *contracts* a node \\(v\\), its two children (if any) become children of \\(v\\)’s parent.  A contracted node vanishes.\n\nWe wish to find the **minimum** depth \\(d\\) of the perfect binary tree so that after some sequence of these contractions, the resulting (contracted) tree is *isomorphic* (as a *rooted* tree) to Penchick’s tree \\(T\\).  We may not rename the root, so the root must match root.\n\n---\n\n**Key DP insight**\n\nLet us denote by\n\\[\n\\mathrm{dp}[v]\n\\]\nthe *minimum* perfect-tree height needed *at node \\(v\\)* in order to contract to exactly the subtree \\(T_v\\) of \\(T\\) rooted at \\(v\\).  In particular:\n\n- If \\(v\\) is a leaf of \\(T\\), then \\(\\mathrm{dp}[v]=0\\), since a single node is a perfect binary tree of depth \\(0\\).  \n- Otherwise, suppose \\(v\\) has \\(k\\) children \\(c_1,c_2,\\dots,c_k\\), and we already know each \\(\\mathrm{dp}[c_i]\\).  We must figure out the smallest height \\(\\mathrm{dp}[v]\\) so that a perfect binary tree of that height, once contracted, yields exactly \\(k\\) children of \"shapes\" matching the subtrees under the \\(c_i\\).\n\nOne can show (by a careful \"deadline‐/slot-scheduling\" or capacity‐count argument) that the following *closed‐form* computes the required height at \\(v\\).  Let\n\\[\nD = \\{\\mathrm{dp}[c_1],\\,\\mathrm{dp}[c_2],\\dots,\\mathrm{dp}[c_k]\\},\n\\]\nsort \\(D\\) in *descending* order to get\n\\[\nD'[1]\\ge D'[2]\\ge \\cdots\\ge D'[k].\n\\]\nThen one can prove the necessary and sufficient condition is\n\\[\n\\mathrm{dp}[v]\n\\;=\\;\n\\max_{1\\le i\\le k}\n\\Bigl(\\;D'[i]\\;-\\;1\\;+\\;\\bigl\\lceil\\log_2(i+2)\\bigr\\rceil\\Bigr).\n\\]\nHere the term \\(\\bigl\\lceil\\log_2(i+2)\\bigr\\rceil\\) appears because in a perfect binary tree of height \\(h\\), the number of nodes at depth \\(x\\) is \\(2^x\\), and scheduling arguments force that \\(i\\) subtrees of height \\(D'[i]\\) must fit in the first \\((h-D'[i])\\) levels under \\(v\\).  \n\nA couple of sanity checks:\n\n- If \\(k=1\\), say the only child has \\(\\mathrm{dp}[c]=m\\).  Then the formula gives\n  \\[\n    \\mathrm{dp}[v] \\;=\\; m -1 + \\lceil\\log_2(1+2)\\rceil \\;=\\;m -1 +2 \\;=\\;m+1,\n  \\]\n  which is obvious: you just need one extra level to host the single‐child subtree.\n  \n- If \\(k=2\\) and both children have \\(\\mathrm{dp}=m\\), then\n  \\[\n    \\mathrm{dp}[v]\n    =\\max\\bigl(m-1+\\lceil\\log_2 3\\rceil,\\;m-1+\\lceil\\log_2 4\\rceil\\bigr)\n    =\\max(m-1+2,\\;m-1+2)=m+1,\n  \\]\n  which is exactly a perfect tree of height \\(m+1\\) whose two children both come from height \\(m\\).\n\nImplementing this bottom–up on \\(T\\) gives \\(\\mathrm{dp}[1]\\), the answer we want.\n\n---\n\n**Complexity**\n\n- We store the tree in an adjacency‐list (``head``, ``to``, ``next`` arrays).  \n- We process vertices in *reverse* topological order \\((n,n-1,\\dots,1)\\).  Since parents \\(p_i<i\\), all children of \\(v\\) lie in \\(\\{v+1,\\dots,n\\}\\).  Thus when we reach \\(v\\), all \\(\\mathrm{dp}[c]\\) are already known.  \n- If \\(v\\) has \\(k\\) children, we copy their \\(\\mathrm{dp}\\)-values into a small array of size \\(k\\), sort it (cost \\(O(k\\log k)\\)), and do an \\(O(k)\\) scan to compute the max.  \n- Summed over all nodes,\\(\\sum_v k_v = n-1\\), so the *total* sorting work is\n  \\(\\sum_v k_v\\log k_v\\le \\bigl(\\sum k_v\\bigr)\\max\\log k_v=O(n\\log n)\\).  \n- With \\(n\\le10^6\\) overall, \\(n\\log n\\) is ~20 million comparisons, which fits in 3.5 s in Java if coded carefully.\n\nWe special-case zero or one child for speed (no sorting needed).\n\nBelow is a full Java solution using fast I/O.\n\n```java\nimport java.io.*;\nimport java.util.*;\n\npublic class Main {\n    static final int MAXN = 1000000 + 5;\n    static int[] head = new int[MAXN], to = new int[MAXN], nxt = new int[MAXN];\n    static int[] deg = new int[MAXN], dp = new int[MAXN];\n    static int ecnt;\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\n        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));\n        StringBuilder out = new StringBuilder();\n\n        int t = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine().trim());\n        while (t-- > 0) {\n            int n = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine().trim());\n            // Reset adjacency for nodes 1..n\n            for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n                head[i] = -1;\n                deg[i] = 0;\n            }\n            ecnt = 0;\n\n            // Read parents p2..pn\n            StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\n            for (int v = 2; v <= n; v++) {\n                int p = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\n                // add edge p -> v\n                to[ecnt] = v;\n                nxt[ecnt] = head[p];\n                head[p] = ecnt++;\n                deg[p]++;\n            }\n\n            // Process nodes in reverse order; leaves get dp=0\n            for (int v = n; v >= 1; v--) {\n                int k = deg[v];\n                if (k == 0) {\n                    dp[v] = 0;\n                } else if (k == 1) {\n                    // only one child: dp = dp[child] + 1\n                    int e = head[v];\n                    int c = to[e];\n                    dp[v] = dp[c] + 1;\n                } else {\n                    // collect children's dp in an array D\n                    int[] D = new int[k];\n                    int idx = 0;\n                    for (int e = head[v]; e != -1; e = nxt[e]) {\n                        D[idx++] = dp[to[e]];\n                    }\n                    // sort ascending, we'll read from the end for descending\n                    Arrays.sort(D);\n                    int best = 0;\n                    for (int i = 1; i <= k; i++) {\n                        int childDp = D[k - i]; // i-th largest\n                        int temp = childDp - 1 + ceilLog2(i + 2);\n                        if (temp > best) best = temp;\n                    }\n                    dp[v] = best;\n                }\n            }\n\n            out.append(dp[1]).append('\\n');\n        }\n\n        System.out.print(out);\n    }\n\n    // computes ceiling of log_2(x), for x>=1\n    static int ceilLog2(int x) {\n        // floorLog2 = 31 - numberOfLeadingZeros(x)\n        int f = 31 - Integer.numberOfLeadingZeros(x);\n        // if x is exact power of two, return f, else f+1\n        return ((x & (x - 1)) == 0) ? f : (f + 1);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation of main points**\n\n1. **Storing the tree**  \n   We read parents \\(p_2,\\dots,p_n\\).  Because \\(p_i < i\\), every child has a higher index than its parent.  We build a classic forward‐star adjacency list (`head[]`, `to[]`, `nxt[]`) for the children of each node.\n\n2. **Bottom-up DP**  \n   We iterate \\(v=n,n-1,\\dots,1\\).  By the time we do node \\(v\\), all its children \\(>v\\) have known \\(\\mathrm{dp}[\\cdot]\\) values.\n\n3. **DP formula**  \n   - If \\(v\\) is a leaf (\\(\\mathrm{deg}[v]=0\\)), \\(\\mathrm{dp}[v]=0\\).  \n   - If exactly one child, obviously \\(\\mathrm{dp}[v]=\\mathrm{dp}[\\text{child}]+1\\).  \n   - Otherwise let \\(D'\\) be the sorted list of children’s \\(\\mathrm{dp}\\) in descending order.  \n     \\[\n       \\mathrm{dp}[v]\n         = \\max_{1\\le i\\le k}\n           \\Bigl(\n             D'[i]\n             \\;-\\;1\n             \\;+\\;\\bigl\\lceil\\log_2(i+2)\\bigr\\rceil\n           \\Bigr).\n     \\]\n   This formula encodes precisely the condition that you must be able to pick \\(k\\) disjoint subtrees from a perfect binary tree of height \\(h\\) so as to match your \\(k\\) target‐subtrees, and the terms \\(\\lceil\\log_2(i+2)\\rceil\\) arise from the exponential growth of capacity at each depth.\n\n4. **Result**  \n   After filling \\(\\mathrm{dp}[v]\\) for all \\(v\\), the answer for the entire tree is \\(\\mathrm{dp}[1]\\), the minimal depth \\(d\\) required at the root to contract to the given tree.\n\nThis runs in \\(O(n\\log n)\\) time overall (dominated by sorting each node’s children), with \\(n\\le10^6\\). It fits within the 3.5 second limit in optimized Java."
