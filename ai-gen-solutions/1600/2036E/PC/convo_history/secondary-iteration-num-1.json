Reverse the Rivers\n\ntime limit per test2 seconds\n\nmemory limit per test256 megabytes\n\nA conspiracy of ancient sages, who decided to redirect rivers for their own convenience, has put the world on the brink. But before implementing their grand plan, they decided to carefully think through their strategy — that's what sages do.\n\n\n\nThere are n\n\n countries, each with exactly k\n\n regions. For the j\n\n-th region of the i\n\n-th country, they calculated the value ai,j\n\n, which reflects the amount of water in it.\n\n\n\nThe sages intend to create channels between the j\n\n-th region of the i\n\n-th country and the j\n\n-th region of the (i+1)\n\n-th country for all 1≤i≤(n−1)\n\n and for all 1≤j≤k\n\n.\n\n\n\nSince all n\n\n countries are on a large slope, water flows towards the country with the highest number. According to the sages' predictions, after the channel system is created, the new value of the j\n\n-th region of the i\n\n-th country will be bi,j=a1,j|a2,j|...|ai,j\n\n, where |\n\n denotes the bitwise \"OR\" operation.\n\n\n\nAfter the redistribution of water, the sages aim to choose the most suitable country for living, so they will send you q\n\n queries for consideration.\n\n\n\nEach query will contain m\n\n requirements.\n\n\n\nEach requirement contains three parameters: the region number r\n\n, the sign o\n\n (either \"<\n\n\" or \">\n\n\"), and the value c\n\n. If o\n\n = \"<\n\n\", then in the r\n\n-th region of the country you choose, the new value must be strictly less than the limit c\n\n, and if o\n\n = \">\n\n\", it must be strictly greater.\n\n\n\nIn other words, the chosen country i\n\n must satisfy all m\n\n requirements. If in the current requirement o\n\n = \"<\n\n\", then it must hold that bi,r<c\n\n, and if o\n\n = \">\n\n\", then bi,r>c\n\n.\n\n\n\nIn response to each query, you should output a single integer — the number of the suitable country. If there are multiple such countries, output the smallest one. If no such country exists, output −1\n\n.\n\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains three integers n\n\n, k\n\n, and q\n\n (1≤n,k,q≤105\n\n) — the number of countries, regions, and queries, respectively.\n\n\n\nNext, there are n\n\n lines, where the i\n\n-th line contains k\n\n integers ai,1,ai,2,…,ai,k\n\n (1≤ai,j≤109\n\n), where ai,j\n\n is the value of the j\n\n-th region of the i\n\n-th country.\n\n\n\nThen, q\n\n queries are described.\n\n\n\nThe first line of each query contains a single integer m\n\n (1≤m≤105\n\n) — the number of requirements.\n\n\n\nThen follow m\n\n lines, each containing an integer r\n\n, a character o\n\n, and an integer c\n\n (1≤r≤k\n\n, 0≤c≤2⋅109\n\n), where r\n\n and c\n\n are the region number and the value, and o\n\n is either \"<\n\n\" or \">\n\n\" — the sign.\n\n\n\nIt is guaranteed that n⋅k\n\n does not exceed 105\n\n and that the sum of m\n\n across all queries also does not exceed 105\n\n.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each query, output a single integer on a new line — the smallest number of the suitable country, or −1\n\n if no such country exists.\n\n\n\nExample\n\nInputCopy\n\n3 4 4\n\n1 3 5 9\n\n4 6 5 3\n\n2 1 2 7\n\n3\n\n1 > 4\n\n2 < 8\n\n1 < 6\n\n2\n\n1 < 8\n\n2 > 8\n\n1\n\n3 > 5\n\n2\n\n4 > 8\n\n1 < 8\n\nOutputCopy\n\n2\n\n-1\n\n3\n\n1\n\nNote\n\nIn the example, the initial values of the regions are as follows:\n\n\n\n1\n\n3\n\n5\n\n9\n\n4\n\n6\n\n5\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n2\n\n7\n\nAfter creating the channels, the new values will look like this:\n\n\n\n1\n\n3\n\n5\n\n9\n\n1|4\n\n3|6\n\n5|5\n\n9|3\n\n1|4|2\n\n3|6|1\n\n5|5|2\n\n9|3|7\n\n↓\n\n1\n\n3\n\n5\n\n9\n\n5\n\n7\n\n5\n\n11\n\n7\n\n7\n\n7\n\n15\n\nIn the first query, it is necessary to output the minimum country number (i.e., row) where, after the redistribution of water in the first region (i.e., column), the new value will be greater than four and less than six, and in the second region it will be less than eight. Only the country with number 2\n\n meets these requirements.\n\n\n\nIn the second query, there are no countries that meet the specified requirements.\n\n\n\nIn the third query, only the country with number 3\n\n is suitable.\n\n\n\nIn the fourth query, all three countries meet the conditions, so the answer is the smallest number 1\n\n.\n\nUse Java."

    "content": "**Analysis**\n\nWe have \\(n\\) countries (indexed \\(1\\) through \\(n\\)), each with exactly \\(k\\) regions (indexed \\(1\\) through \\(k\\)).  Let \\(a_{i,j}\\) be the initial water amount in region \\(j\\) of country \\(i\\).  The sages build a cascading system of channels so that after redistribution the new amount in region \\(j\\) of country \\(i\\) is\n\n\\[\nb_{i,j}\n\\;=\\;\na_{1,j}\\;\\bigl|\\;a_{2,j}\\;\\bigl|\\;\\cdots\\;\\bigl|\\;a_{i,j}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\lvert\\) is bitwise OR.  Note that for each fixed \\(j\\), the sequence\n\n\\[\nb_{1,j},\\,b_{2,j},\\,\\dots,\\,b_{n,j}\n\\]\n\nis non-decreasing, because once a bit is turned on by an OR it never turns off.\n\nWe must answer \\(q\\) queries.  Each query has \\(m\\) requirements of the form\n\n```\nregion r, sign o in {<,>}, threshold c\n```\n\nWe want the smallest country index \\(i\\) for which **all** requirements hold simultaneously:\n\n- If the requirement is `r < c`, then \\(b_{i,r} < c\\).\n- If the requirement is `r > c`, then \\(b_{i,r} > c\\).\n\nBecause for each region \\(r\\) the array \\(\\bigl(b_{1,r},b_{2,r},\\dots,b_{n,r}\\bigr)\\) is non-decreasing, each single requirement carves out a single contiguous interval of valid \\(i\\) values:\n\n1.  Requirement \\(b_{i,r} < c\\).  \n    -  If \\(b_{1,r} \\ge c\\), **no** \\(i\\) works.\n    -  Otherwise, let \n       \\[\n         \\text{pos} \n         = \\min\\{i \\mid b_{i,r} \\ge c\\}\n         = \\text{lower\\_bound}(b_{\\cdot,r},\\,c).\n       \\]\n       Then all \\(i < \\text{pos}\\) satisfy \\(b_{i,r}<c\\).  So the valid \\(i\\) form the interval \\([1,\\;\\text{pos}-1]\\).\n\n2.  Requirement \\(b_{i,r} > c\\).  \n    -  If \\(b_{n,r} \\le c\\), **no** \\(i\\) works.\n    -  Otherwise, let \n       \\[\n         \\text{pos} \n         = \\min\\{i \\mid b_{i,r} > c\\}\n         = \\text{upper\\_bound}(b_{\\cdot,r},\\,c).\n       \\]\n       Then all \\(i \\ge \\text{pos}\\) satisfy \\(b_{i,r}>c\\).  So the valid \\(i\\) form the interval \\([\\text{pos},\\;n]\\).\n\nTo answer a query with \\(m\\) requirements, we intersect all these intervals.  If the intersection is empty, the answer is \\(-1\\).  Otherwise it is the left-endpoint of the intersection.  \n\nSince \\(\\sum m\\le10^5\\) and \\(n\\cdot k\\le10^5\\), we can:\n\n1.  Precompute all \\(b_{i,j}\\) in \\(O(n\\,k)\\).\n2.  For each requirement do one binary search in \\(O(\\log n)\\).\n3.  Each query takes \\(O(m\\log n)\\), overall \\(O\\bigl((n\\,k) + (\\sum m)\\log n\\bigr)\\), which is efficient.\n\n---\n\n**Java Implementation**\n\n```java\nimport java.io.*;\nimport java.util.*;\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\n        BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));\n        StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(in.readLine());\n        int n = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\n        int k = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\n        int q = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\n        \n        // Read a[i][j], build b[j][i] = OR of column j from row 0..i\n        // We'll store b[j] as an int-array of length n.\n        int[][] b = new int[k][n];\n        \n        for (int i = 0;

Since \\(\\sum m\\le10^5\\) and \\(nk\\le10^5\\), the overall complexity is comfortably within the limits."
