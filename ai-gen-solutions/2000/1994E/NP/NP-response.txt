**Analysis**

We have a rooted‐forest of total size \(N\le10^6\).  We want to remove the entire forest by repeatedly “cutting out” a subtree at some vertex; each cut yields one _piece_ whose size is the number of vertices in that subtree _at the time of the cut_.  In the end we will have a partition of all \(N\) vertices into disjoint pieces, and we want to maximize the bitwise‐OR of the sizes of those pieces.

A key insight is that the order of cuts does not matter; what matters is merely _which_ subtrees we choose to cut _as whole pieces_ and, for those cuts that lie on top of one another in the original tree, how the later cuts reduce the sizes (and hence the bit‐patterns) of earlier ones.  Carrying out the full combinatorial search is intractable.  However, it turns out that one can do a simple “bit-by-bit” greedy:

1.  We will build the answer in descending order of bits (from the highest bit down to bit 0).
2.  Suppose we have already decided some bits in `ans`.  Let us try to see whether we can also force in the next lower bit \(b\).  Call  
      \[
         X = \text{(bits already in `ans`)} \;\big|\;(1\ll b).
      \]
    We ask: _is there a valid way to pick cuts so that the OR of piece‐sizes covers all bits of_ \(X\)?

3.  To test “feasibility” of \(X\), we form a simple one‐pass greedy over the nodes in _post‐order_ (so children come before parents).  At each node \(v\), we check whether the bit‐mask
      \[
         m_v = (\mathrm{sz}[v]\;\&\;X)
      \]
    contains any bit that we have not yet “covered.”  If it does _and_ if cutting at \(v\) would not conflict with any previously chosen cut (i.e.\ we have not already chosen a descendant _or_ an ancestor of \(v\)), then we “choose” \(v\), add \(m_v\) to our running `covered` mask, and record that choice.  

    We maintain two Fenwick trees (BITs) of size \(N\) over the DFS “time‐in/time‐out” intervals:

    -  **BIT1** implements a _range‐add, point‐query_ so that at time‐in \(t\) we can quickly ask “how many chosen ancestors does this node have?”  
    -  **BIT2** implements a _point‐add, range‐sum_ so that over \([\,\text{tin}(v),\,\text{tout}(v)\,]\) we can quickly ask “how many chosen descendants does this node have?”  

    We only select \(v\) if both queries return zero.  We stop as soon as our `covered` mask has all bits of \(X\).  If we succeed, then bit \(b\) _can_ be included in the final OR; otherwise it cannot.

Since \(N\le10^6\) in total over all test‐cases, and each integer size is at most \(10^6\) (so at most 20 bits), the overall cost is
\[
   O\Bigl(N + 20\,( \text{DFS}+ \text{bit‐checks} )\Bigr)
   \;=\;O(N\log N)
\]
which runs comfortably in 2 s in Java if carefully implemented.

**Explanation of the main ideas**

1. **Subtree‐sizes and post‐order.**  
   We first do a single DFS over the entire forest to compute each node’s subtree size `sz[v]`, to assign Euler‐tin/tout times in `tin[v]`,`tout[v]`, and to record a _post‐order_ list `order[]` of all nodes.  In post‐order, every child appears before its parent, which is exactly the order in which we want to try “cutting” subtrees from deepest upward.

2. **Fenwicks for conflict‐detection.**  
   When we pick a node \(v\) as a cut, in the _true_ process that cut will remove all of \(v\)’s subtree from its ancestors’ later pieces.  To keep our greedy simple, we only ever cut a node \(v\) if _no_ already‐chosen cut lies _above_ it (an ancestor) and _no_ already‐chosen cut lies _below_ it (a descendant).  Such cuts are always valid “whole‐subtree” cuts whose piece‐size is exactly `sz[v]`.  

   -  **Fenwick #1** (`bitAnc`) supports range‐add + point‐query so that if we do `rangeAdd(tin[v], tout[v],1)`, then any descendant’s `tin[x]` will have Fenwick‐sum>0, meaning “you have a chosen ancestor.”  
   -  **Fenwick #2** (`bitDesc`) supports point‐add + range‐sum so that if we mark a cut at `tin[v]`, then any ancestor \(u\) can do `rangeSum(tin[u],tout[u])` to see if one of its descendants was already chosen.

3. **Bitwise greedy**.  
   We build the final OR‐mask `ans` by testing from the highest bit downward.  Suppose we have already set some higher bits in `ans`.  We now _tentatively_ add bit \(b\), forming
   \[
     X = \text{ans} \;\cup\;(1\ll b).
   \]
   We ask: _can we arrange cuts so that the OR of their piece‐sizes covers every bit in_ \(X\)?  

   - We sweep the nodes in post‐order.  
   - At node \(v\) let `m = sz[v] & X`.  Those are the bits that the subtree‐size of \(v\) _could_ contribute.  
   - If `m` covers any bit not yet in our covered‐mask, and if cutting at \(v\) is conflict‐free (no chosen ancestor/descendant), we _choose_ \(v\), mark those bits covered, and record the cut in both Fenwicks.  
   - If by the end all bits of \(X\) are covered, we return “yes, feasible” and thus keep bit \(b\) in `ans`.  Otherwise we must leave it out.

Because there are at most 20 bits (sizes ≤10<sup>6</sup>) and each “feasibility” test is a single pass over the \(N\) nodes plus \(O(N\log N)\) Fenwick operations, the total is \(O(N\log N)\).  Since \(\sum N\le10^6\), this easily runs in under 2 s in Java.
