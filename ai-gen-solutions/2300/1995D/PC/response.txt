**Analysis**

We are given

- A text string \(s\) of length \(n\), consisting of the first \(c\) letters of the Latin alphabet (so letters \(\mathrm{A},\dots,\mathrm{A}+c-1\)).
- In the unknown language each word has length at most \(k\) and ends in exactly one special "case" letter; different letters are different cases, and a word cannot end in a letter for which the language has no case.
- The text is written *without* spaces, so we must chop the string \(s\) into blocks (words) of length \(\le k\), each block ending in a letter chosen from some subset \(S\subseteq\{\text{A},\dots\}\).  We want to find the smallest possible size of that subset \(S\).

Equivalently, if we think of \(S\) as the set of letters that *are* valid word‐endings, then to be able to chop \(s\) into pieces of length \(\le k\) each ending in one of the letters of \(S\), it is necessary and sufficient that

1. **Every length‐\(k\) window of the text must contain at least one letter from \(S\).**  
   Indeed, if you ever had \(k\) consecutive letters none of which is in \(S\), you would be forced to end a word only *after* those \(k\) letters (or before), and that would create a word of length \(>k\) or leave the string uncovered.
2. **The very last character \(s_{n}\) must itself be in \(S\),** because the last word must end exactly at position \(n\).

Thus the problem becomes:

  - We form all length‐\(k\) substrings ("windows") of \(s\).  Record for each window the set \(U\) of distinct letters that appear in that window.
  - We want to choose a set \(S\) of letters so that
    1. \(S\cap U\neq\emptyset\) for *every* window \(U\).
    2. \(s_n\in S\).
  - Among all \(S\) satisfying these two conditions, we want \(\lvert S\rvert\) as small as possible.

That is a classic *hitting‐set* condition: each window \(U\) demands "hit" by \(S\).  The universe of letters has size \(c\le18\), so we can afford a \(2^c\)‐style DP.  Let us index letters by \(0,1,\dots,c-1\).  We will represent any subset of letters by a bitmask of up to \(c\) bits.

**Step 1.  Build the frequency table of window‐masks.**

- If \(k\ge n\), there are no length‐\(k\) windows (or you can think of it as a single window of length \(n<k\)), and the only requirement is that \(s_n\in S\).  Hence the answer is 1.
- Otherwise, we slide a window of length \(k\) over all positions \(i=0,1,\dots,n-k\).  We maintain a letter‐count array `cnt[0..c-1]` and a bitmask `wmask` recording which letters have positive counts.  Each time we slide, we decrement the count of the letter leaving the window, increment the count of the letter entering, update `wmask`, and then do `g[wmask]++`.  Here `g[mask]` will count how many windows have *exactly* that letter‐set `mask`.

**Step 2.  Do a subset‐sum (SOS) DP to detect which masks of letters fail to hit some window.**

A mask \(S\) *fails* if there is *some* window whose letter‐set \(U\) is disjoint from \(S\).  Equivalently, \(U\subseteq \overline S\).  Let

- `g[u]` = number of windows whose set of letters is exactly `u`.
- We define `h[t] = sum_{s ⊆ t} g[s]`.  

Then if we take `t = (allLettersMask) ^ S` (the complement of `S`), `h[t]` counts how many windows have letter‐set disjoint from `S`.  We only accept `S` if `h[complement_of_S] == 0`.

The SOS DP to compute all `h[t]` from `g` is standard and takes \(O(c\cdot 2^c)\).

**Step 3.  Scan all masks \(S\) that contain the final letter \(s_n\) and pick the one of minimum popcount for which `h[comp] == 0`.**

Because \(\sum 2^c\le2\cdot10^5\) over all test cases and \(\sum n\le2\cdot10^5\), the total cost
\[
  \sum_{\text{tests}}\bigl(O(n) + O(c\,2^c)\bigr)
\]
is perfectly safe within a 2‐second limit.

**Explanation of key steps**

1.  **Sliding‐window mask construction**  
    We maintain `cnt[letter]` = how many times `letter` appears in the current window of length `k`.  Whenever `cnt[x]` goes from 0→1 we set the bit for `x`; whenever it goes from 1→0 we clear that bit.  In `g[mask]` we count how many windows have *exactly* that mask of letters.

2.  **SOS (subset‐sum) transform**  
    We build `h[mask] = sum_{sub ⊆ mask} g[sub]`.  Then for any chosen set of cases `S`, let `comp = (~S) & ((1<<c)-1)`.  If `h[comp] > 0`, that means there was a window whose letter‐set `U` was a subset of `comp`, i.e.\ disjoint from `S`, so `S` fails.  We keep only those `S` with `h[comp] == 0`.

3.  **Minimal popcount**  
    Among all valid `S` that also include the final letter `s[n-1]`, we take the one with smallest bit‐count.  That is the answer.

This runs in \(O(n + c\,2^c)\) per test, and the constraints guarantee \(\sum n\le2\cdot10^5\), \(\sum2^c\le2\cdot10^5\), so we stay within time and memory limits.
