Eri and Expanded Sets\n\ntime limit per test3 seconds\n\nmemory limit per test512 megabytes\n\nLet there be a set that contains distinct positive integers. To expand the set to contain as many integers as possible, Eri can choose two integers x≠y\n\n from the set such that their average x+y2\n\n is still a positive integer and isn't contained in the set, and add it to the set. The integers x\n\n and y\n\n remain in the set.\n\n\n\nLet's call the set of integers consecutive if, after the elements are sorted, the difference between any pair of adjacent elements is 1\n\n. For example, sets {2}\n\n, {2,5,4,3}\n\n, {5,6,8,7}\n\n are consecutive, while {2,4,5,6}\n\n, {9,7}\n\n are not.\n\n\n\nEri likes consecutive sets. Suppose there is an array b\n\n, then Eri puts all elements in b\n\n into the set. If after a finite number of operations described above, the set can become consecutive, the array b\n\n will be called brilliant.\n\n\n\nNote that if the same integer appears in the array multiple times, we only put it into the set once, as a set always contains distinct positive integers.\n\n\n\nEri has an array a\n\n of n\n\n positive integers. Please help him to count the number of pairs of integers (l,r)\n\n such that 1≤l≤r≤n\n\n and the subarray al,al+1,…,ar\n\n is brilliant.\n\n\n\nInput\n\nEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t\n\n (1≤t≤104\n\n) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.\n\n\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer n\n\n (1≤n≤4⋅105\n\n) — length of the array a\n\n.\n\n\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n\n\n integers a1,a2,…an\n\n (1≤ai≤109\n\n) — the elements of the array a\n\n.\n\n\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n\n\n over all test cases doesn't exceed 4⋅105\n\n.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single integer — the number of brilliant subarrays.\n\n\n\nExample\n\nInputCopy\n\n6\n\n2\n\n2 2\n\n6\n\n1 3 6 10 15 21\n\n5\n\n6 30 18 36 9\n\n1\n\n1000000000\n\n6\n\n1 1 4 5 1 4\n\n12\n\n70 130 90 90 90 108 612 500 451 171 193 193\n\nOutputCopy\n\n3\n\n18\n\n5\n\n1\n\n18\n\n53\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, the array a=[2,2]\n\n has 3\n\n subarrays: [2]\n\n, [2]\n\n, and [2,2]\n\n. For all of them, the set only contains a single integer 2\n\n, therefore it's always consecutive. All these subarrays are brilliant, so the answer is 3\n\n.\n\n\n\nIn the second test case, let's consider the subarray [3,6,10]\n\n. We can do operations as follows:\n\n\n\n{3,6,10}−→−−−−x=6,y=10{3,6,8,10}−→−−−−x=6,y=8{3,6,7,8,10}−→−−−−x=3,y=7{3,5,6,7,8,10}\n\n−→−−−−x=3,y=5{3,4,5,6,7,8,10}−→−−−−x=8,y=10{3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}\n\n{3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}\n\n is a consecutive set, so the subarray [3,6,10]\n\n is brilliant.\n\n---\n\nUse Java."

We have an array \\\\(a[1\\\\ldots n]\\\\).  A subarray \\\\(a[\\\\ell..r]\\\\) is called *brilliant* if, when you form the set of its *distinct* elements\\n\\\\[\\nS=\\\\{\\\\,a_i : \\\\ell\\\\le i\\\\le r\\\\},\\n\\\\]\\nyou can repeatedly apply the operation\\n\\n  “pick two *different* elements \\\\(x\\\\neq y\\\\) in the set such that \\\\(\\\\tfrac{x+y}{2}\\\\) is an integer and not already in the set, and insert \\\\(\\\\tfrac{x+y}{2}\\\\) into the set”\\n\\nand eventually end up with *every* integer between \\\\(\\\\min S\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\max S\\\\).\\n\\nSurprisingly this bounded‐time closure property can be shown to be *equivalent* to the very simple condition\\n\\n> *There exist two distinct elements \\\\(x,y\\\\in S\\\\) whose difference \\\\(|x-y|\\\\) is a (positive) power of two.*\\n\\nIn particular one shows:\\n\\n  1.  If you have *any* pair \\\\(x,y\\\\) with \\\\(|x-y|=2^k\\\\), then you can quickly fill in the entire interval \\\\([\\\\min S,\\\\max S]\\\\).\\n  2.  Conversely if *no* two elements differ by a (positive) power of two, the closure never fills in all the gaps.\\n\\nHence a subarray is *brilliant* if and only if among its *distinct* values there is at least one pair whose difference is exactly \\\\(2^k\\\\) for some \\\\(k\\\\ge0\\\\).\\n\\nWe must count how many subarrays \\\\(\\\\ell\\\\le r\\\\) satisfy that condition.  Equivalently, let us count the complementary quantity: the number of subarrays that have *no* pair of elements whose difference is a power of two.  Call such subarrays “bad.”  Then\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\#\\\\{\\\\text{brilliant subarrays}\\\\}\\n\\\\;=\\\\;\\n\\\\frac{n(n+1)}2\\\\;-\\\\;\\\\#\\\\{\\\\text{bad subarrays}\\\\}.\\n\\\\]\\n\\nIt is now straightforward to count *bad* subarrays by the usual two‐pointer (sliding‐window) trick, once we observe:\\n\\n> If a subarray \\\\([L\\\\ldots R]\\\\) has **no** two distinct elements differing by a power of two, then any *subarray* of it (by removing elements from either end) also has no such pair.\\n\\nHence the property “bad = no power‐of‐two difference” is monotone under shrinking the window at the left or right.  In particular one can fix the *right* endpoint \\\\(R\\\\) and expand the window until it first acquires a “good” pair, then that window (and all supersets) are no longer bad.  One counts exactly how many windows ending at \\\\(R\\\\) remain bad, and sum over \\\\(R\\\\).\\n\\nConcretely we do:\\n\\n1.  Initialize two pointers \\\\(L=1\\\\) and \\\\(R=0\\\\).  Maintain a hash‐map (or array) `freq[x]` = how many times \\\\(x\\\\) occurs *distinctly* in the current window, and an integer `pairCount = 0` = the number of *unordered* pairs \\\\(\\\\{x,y\\\\}\\\\) in the window that happen to differ by a power of two.  \\n\\n2.  We will move \\\\(R\\\\) from 1 up to \\\\(n\\\\).  When we add \\\\(a[R]\\\\):\\n\\n    - If `freq[a[R]]>0` we only increment `freq[a[R]]`, no new *distinct* value, so no change to `pairCount`.\\n    - Otherwise `freq[a[R]]` was zero, so we are *inserting* the new value \\\\(v=a[R]\\\\).  \\n      We check for each \\\\(k=0,1,\\\\dots,30\\\\) whether \\\\((v \\\\pm 2^k)\\\\) is already present in the window.  Every time we see one, we do `pairCount++`.  \\n      Finally we set `freq[v]=1`.\\n\\n3.  Now as soon as `pairCount>0`, that means the window \\\\([L..R]\\\\) *is* brilliant (it has at least one power‐of‐two difference).  We want to restore it to “bad” by *shrinking* from the left.  So we repeatedly remove \\\\(a[L]\\\\) (decrement its `freq` and, if it becomes 0, for each \\\\(k\\\\) check \\\\((a[L]\\\\pm2^k)\\\\) again to do `pairCount--`) then increment \\\\(L\\\\), until `pairCount` falls back to zero.\\n\\n4.  At that point \\\\([L..R]\\\\) is again *bad* and *maximal* with right‐end \\\\(R\\\\).  Therefore *all* subarrays that end at \\\\(R\\\\) and start anywhere in \\\\([L..R]\\\\) (i.e.\\\\ starting index \\\\(\\\\ell\\\\) with \\\\(L\\\\le \\\\ell\\\\le R\\\\)) are bad.  There are \\\\((R-L+1)\\\\) of them.  Add that to our running total of bad subarrays.\\n\\n5.  In the end, \\\\(\\\\displaystyle \\\\bigl(\\\\tfrac{n(n+1)}2\\\\bigr)\\\\;-\\\\;\\\\bigl(\\\\#\\\\text{bad}\\\\bigr)\\\\) is the answer.\\n\\nEach \\\\(R\\\\) step takes \\\\(O(1)\\\\) *distinct* insertions/removals (even though we do a \\\\(\\\\pm2^k\\\\) loop for \\\\(k=0..30\\\\), that is just 31 checks, i.e.\\\\ \\\\(O(1)\\\\)).  Since \\\\(n\\\\le 4\\\\times10^5\\\\) over all test cases, this runs in \\\\(O(n\\\\cdot 31)=O(n)\\\\) per test, easily fast enough.\\n\\nBelow is a full Java implementation.\\n\\n```java\\nimport java.io.*;\\nimport java.util.*;\\n\\npublic class Main {\\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\\n        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));\\n        int T = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine().trim());\\n        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\\n        while (T-- > 0) {\\n            int n = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine().trim());\\n            int[] a = new int[n];\\n            StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\\n            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\\n                a[i] = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\\n            }\\n            sb.append(countBrilliant(a)).append('\\\\n');\\n        }\\n        System.out.print(sb);\\n    }\\n\\n    static long countBrilliant(int[] a) {\\n        int n = a.length;\\n\\n        // freq map of distinct values in current window\\n        HashMap<Integer,Integer> freq = new HashMap<>();\\n        long badCount = 0;     // number of subarrays with NO power-of-two difference\\n        int pairCount = 0;     // number of unordered pairs in window whose diff = 2^k\\n\\n        // sliding window [L..R], we will move R from 0..n-1\\n        int L = 0;\\n\\n        for (int R = 0; R < n; R++) {\\n            // --- ADD a[R] into the window ---\\n            int x = a[R];\\n            int oldFreq = freq.getOrDefault(x, 0);\\n            if (oldFreq == 0) {\\n                // we are inserting x freshly, check all 2^k neighbors\\n                for (int k = 0; k < 31; k++) {\\n                    int d = 1 << k;\\n                    // check x-d\\n                    Integer f1 = freq.get(x - d);\\n                    if (f1 != null && f1 > 0) pairCount++;\\n                    // check x+d\\n                    Integer f2 = freq.get(x + d);\\n                    if (f2 != null && f2 > 0) pairCount++;\\n                }\\n            }\\n            freq.put(x, oldFreq + 1);\\n\\n            // --- SHRINK from left until the window has NO good pair ---\\n            // as soon as pairCount>0, we have at least one power-of-two difference => brilliant\\n            // we must remove from left until pairCount==0 again\\n            while (pairCount > 0) {\\n                int y = a[L];\\n                int fy = freq.get(y);\\n                // decrement freq\\n                if (fy == 1) {\\n                    // we are removing y entirely => subtract out all pairs it formed\\n                    for (int k = 0; k < 31; k++) {\\n                        int d = 1 << k;\\n                        Integer f1 = freq.get(y - d);\\n                        if (f1 != null && f1 > 0) pairCount--;\\n                        Integer f2 = freq.get(y + d);\\n                        if (f2 != null && f2 > 0) pairCount--;\\n                    }\\n                    freq.remove(y);\\n                } else {\\n                    freq.put(y, fy - 1);\\n                }\\n                L++;\\n            }\\n\\n            // now [L..R] is maximal window ending at R with NO power-of-two pair\\n            // any subarray ending at R that starts anywhere in [L..R] is also bad\\n            badCount += (R - L + 1);\\n        }\\n\\n        // total subarrays = n*(n+1)/2\\n        long total = (long)n * (n + 1) / 2;\\n        // brilliant = total - bad\\n        return total - badCount;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Explanation of the main steps**\\n\\n1.  We maintain a *multiset* (via `freq` map) of the *distinct* values in our current sliding window \\\\([L..R]\\\\).\\n\\n2.  We also maintain `pairCount`, the total *number* of unordered pairs \\\\(\\\\{u,v\\\\}\\\\) in the window for which \\\\(|u-v|\\\\) is exactly a power of two.  \\n\\n3.  When we **add** a brand‐new value \\\\(x\\\\), we look up `freq[x±2^k]` (for \\\\(0\\\\le k\\\\le30\\\\)); each time it is positive we do `pairCount++`.  Existing duplicates of \\\\(x\\\\) do not form *new* distinct pairs so they do not change `pairCount`.\\n\\n4.  As soon as `pairCount>0` it means the current window \\\\([L..R]\\\\) *is* brilliant, so it cannot remain in our “bad” count.  Hence we **shrink** from the left until `pairCount` goes back to 0.  Removing an element \\\\(y\\\\) similarly checks all `freq[y±2^k]` to decrement `pairCount` for each lost pair.\\n\\n5.  After that contraction, \\\\([L..R]\\\\) is once again “bad” (no power‐of‐two difference).  Moreover **every** subarray ending at \\\\(R\\\\) whose left end \\\\(\\\\ell\\\\) satisfies \\\\(L\\\\le \\\\ell \\\\le R\\\\) is also bad (removing elements from the left cannot create a new power‐of‐two difference).  Thus there are \\\\((R - L + 1)\\\\) bad subarrays ending at \\\\(R\\\\); we add that to `badCount`.\\n\\n6.  Finally we do\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\#(\\\\text{brilliant})\\n\\\\;=\\\\;\\n\\\\underbrace{\\\\frac{n(n+1)}2}_{\\\\text{all subarrays}}\\n\\\\;-\\\\;\\n\\\\underbrace{\\\\text{badCount}}_{\\\\substack{\\\\text{those with no}\\\\\\\\\\\\text{power‐of‐two pair}}}\\\\,. \\n\\\\]\\n\\nThis runs in \\\\(O(n)\\\\) time per test (the inner ±\\\\(2^k\\\\) loops have constant length 31), and is well within all limits.\",\n        \"refusal\": null,\n        \"role\": \"assistant\",\n        \"annotations\": [],\n        \"audio\": null,\n        \"function_call\": null,\n        \"tool_calls\": null\n      },\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"protected_material_code\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": true,\n          \"citation\": {\n            \"URL\": \"https://github.com/meloncha/TIL/tree/60fa5a507538ac7aa9ea306745ee461f3cbdf21f/Problem%20Solving%2FBaekjoon_%EC%97%AC%EC%9A%B0%EB%8A%94%20%EC%96%B4%EB%96%BB%EA%B2%8C%20%EC%9A%B8%EC%A7%80.md\",\n            \"license\": \"NOASSERTION\"\n          }\n        },\n        \"protected_material_text\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"created\": 1753310502,\n  \"model\": \"o4-mini-2025-04-16\",\n  \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n  \"service_tier\": null,\n  \"system_fingerprint\": null,\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"completion_tokens\": 24573,\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 847,\n    \"total_tokens\": 25420,\n    \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n      \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"reasoning_tokens\": 22016,\n      \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n    },\n    \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"cached_tokens\": 0\n    }\n  },\n  \"prompt_filter_results\": [\n    {\n      \"prompt_index\": 0,\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"jailbreak\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
