The only difference between the two versions is that in this version, you can make at most 7\n\n queries.\n\n\n\nThis is an interactive problem. If you are unsure how interactive problems work, then it is recommended to read the guide for participants.\n\n\n\nWe have a secret ruler that is missing one number x\n\n (2≤x≤999\n\n). When you measure an object of length y\n\n, the ruler reports the following values:\n\n\n\nIf y<x\n\n, the ruler (correctly) measures the object as having length y\n\n.\n\nIf y≥x\n\n, the ruler incorrectly measures the object as having length y+1\n\n.\n\n\n\nThe ruler above is missing the number 4\n\n, so it correctly measures the first segment as length 3\n\n but incorrectly measures the second segment as length 6\n\n even though it is actually 5\n\n.\n\n\n\nYou need to find the value of x\n\n. To do that, you can make queries of the following form:\n\n\n\n? a b\n\n — in response, we will measure the side lengths of an a×b\n\n rectangle with our ruler and multiply the results, reporting the measured area of the rectangle back to you. For example, if x=4\n\n and you query a 3×5\n\n rectangle, we will measure its side lengths as 3×6\n\n and report 18\n\n back to you.\n\nFind the value of x\n\n. You can ask at most 7\n\n queries.\n\n\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a single integer t\n\n (1≤t≤1000\n\n) — the number of test cases.\n\n\n\nInteraction\n\nThere is no initial input for each test case. You should begin the interaction by asking a query.\n\n\n\nTo make a query, output a single line of the form ? a b\n\n (1≤a,b≤1000\n\n). In response, you will be told the measured area of the rectangle, according to our secret ruler.\n\n\n\nWhen you are ready to print the answer, output a single line of the form ! x\n\n (2≤x≤999\n\n). After that, proceed to process the next test case or terminate the program if it was the last test case. Printing the answer does not count as a query.\n\n\n\nThe interactor is not adaptive, meaning that the answer is known before the participant asks the queries and doesn't depend on the queries asked by the participant.\n\n\n\nIf your program makes more than 7\n\n queries for one set of input data, makes an invalid query, or prints the wrong value of x\n\n, then the response to the query will be −1\n\n. After receiving such a response, your program should immediately terminate to receive the verdict Wrong Answer. Otherwise, you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will continue to read from a closed stream.\n\n\n\nAfter printing a query do not forget to output the end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you may get Idleness limit exceeded verdict. To do this, use:\n\n\n\nfflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;\n\nSystem.out.flush() in Java;\n\nflush(output) in Pascal;\n\nstdout.flush() in Python;\n\nsee the documentation for other languages.\n\nHacks\n\n\n\nTo make a hack, use the following format.\n\n\n\nThe first line should contain a single integer t\n\n (1≤t≤1000\n\n) — the number of test cases.\n\n\n\nThe only line of each test case should contain a single integer x\n\n (2≤x≤999\n\n) — the missing number on the ruler.\n\n\n\nExample\n\nInputCopy\n\n2\n\n\n\n18\n\n\n\n25\n\n\n\n\n\n9999\n\nOutputCopy\n\n? 3 5\n\n\n\n? 4 4\n\n\n\n! 4\n\n? 99 100\n\n\n\n! 100\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test, the interaction proceeds as follows.\n\n\n\nSolution\tJury\tExplanation\n\n2\n\nThere are 2 test cases.\n\n? 3 5\n\n18\n\nSecretly, the jury picked x=4\n\n. The solution requests the 3×5\n\n rectangle, and the jury responds with 3×6=18\n\n, as described in the statement.\n\n? 4 4\n\n25\n\nThe solution requests the 4×4\n\n rectangle, which the jury measures as 5×5\n\n and responds with 25\n\n.\n\n! 4\n\nThe solution has somehow determined that x=4\n\n, and outputs it. Since the output is correct, the jury continues to the next test case.\n\n? 99 100\n\n1\n\nSecretly, the jury picked x=100\n\n. The solution requests the 99×100\n\n rectangle, which the jury measures as 99×101\n\n and responds with 9999\n\n.\n\n! 100\n\nThe solution has somehow determined that x=100\n\n, and outputs it. Since the output is correct and there are no more test cases, the jury and the solution exit.\n\nNote that the line breaks in the example input and output are for the sake of clarity, and do not occur in the real interaction.\n\n---\n\nLet's think step-by-step so we don't make mistakes. Use Java. Avoid syntax errors or infinite loops."
