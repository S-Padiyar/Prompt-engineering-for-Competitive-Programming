Turtle and an Incomplete Sequence\n\ntime limit per test3 seconds\n\nmemory limit per test256 megabytes\n\nTurtle was playing with a sequence a1,a2,…,an\n\n consisting of positive integers. Unfortunately, some of the integers went missing while playing.\n\n\n\nNow the sequence becomes incomplete. There may exist an arbitrary number of indices i\n\n such that ai\n\n becomes −1\n\n. Let the new sequence be a′\n\n.\n\n\n\nTurtle is sad. But Turtle remembers that for every integer i\n\n from 1\n\n to n−1\n\n, either ai=⌊ai+12⌋\n\n or ai+1=⌊ai2⌋\n\n holds for the original sequence a\n\n.\n\n\n\nTurtle wants you to help him complete the sequence. But sometimes Turtle makes mistakes, so you need to tell him if you can't complete the sequence.\n\n\n\nFormally, you need to find another sequence b1,b2,…,bn\n\n consisting of positive integers such that:\n\n\n\nFor every integer i\n\n from 1\n\n to n\n\n, if a′i≠−1\n\n, then bi=a′i\n\n.\n\nFor every integer i\n\n from 1\n\n to n−1\n\n, either bi=⌊bi+12⌋\n\n or bi+1=⌊bi2⌋\n\n holds.\n\nFor every integer i\n\n from 1\n\n to n\n\n, 1≤bi≤109\n\n.\n\nIf there is no sequence b1,b2,…,bn\n\n that satisfies all of the conditions above, you need to report −1\n\n.\n\n\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t\n\n (1≤t≤105\n\n). The description of the test cases follows.\n\n\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer n\n\n (2≤n≤2⋅105\n\n) — the length of the sequence.\n\n\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n\n\n integers a′1,a′2,…,a′n\n\n (a′i=−1\n\n or 1≤a′i≤108\n\n) — the elements of the sequence a′\n\n.\n\n\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n\n\n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105\n\n.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, if there is no sequence b1,b2,…,bn\n\n that satisfies all of the conditions, output a single integer −1\n\n.\n\n\n\nOtherwise, output n\n\n integers b1,b2,…,bn\n\n — the elements of the sequence b1,b2,…,bn\n\n you find. The sequence should satisfy that 1≤bi≤109\n\n for every integer i\n\n from 1\n\n to n\n\n. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.\n\n\n\nExample\n\nInputCopy\n\n9\n\n8\n\n-1 -1 -1 2 -1 -1 1 -1\n\n4\n\n-1 -1 -1 -1\n\n6\n\n3 -1 -1 -1 9 -1\n\n4\n\n-1 5 -1 6\n\n4\n\n2 -1 -1 3\n\n4\n\n1 2 3 4\n\n2\n\n4 2\n\n5\n\n-1 3 -1 3 6\n\n13\n\n-1 -1 3 -1 -1 -1 -1 7 -1 -1 3 -1 -1\n\nOutputCopy\n\n4 9 4 2 4 2 1 2\n\n7 3 6 13\n\n3 1 2 4 9 18\n\n-1\n\n-1\n\n-1\n\n4 2\n\n6 3 1 3 6\n\n3 1 3 1 3 7 3 7 3 1 3 1 3\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, [4,2,1,2,1,2,1,3]\n\n can also be the answer, while [4,2,5,10,5,2,1,3]\n\n and [4,2,1,2,1,2,1,4]\n\n cannot.\n\n\n\nIn the second test case, [1,2,5,2]\n\n can also be the answer.\n\n\n\nFrom the fourth to the sixth test cases, it can be shown that there is no answer, so you should output −1\n\n.\n\n---\n\nUse Java."

If at position `i` we know `b[i]`, we set  \\n   \\\\[\\n     b[i-1] = \\n       \\\\begin{cases}\\n         \\\\lfloor b[i]/2\\\\rfloor, & \\\\text{if that is}\\\\ge1,\\\\\\\\\\n         2\\\\cdot b[i],            & \\\\text{otherwise},\\n       \\\\end{cases}\\n   \\\\]\\n   which automatically satisfies one of the two adjacency rules.\\n\\n4. **Filling the suffix after the last known.**  \\n   We walk *forwards* from the last known index up to `n-1`, doing exactly the same rule.\\n\\n5. **Filling each internal segment** \\\\([L..R]\\\\) **with known ends** \\\\(b[L]=A\\\\), \\\\(b[R]=C\\\\).  \\n   - Compute `D = R-L`, the number of steps needed.\\n   - **Quick check**: is \\\\(C\\\\) at all reachable from \\\\(A\\\\) in \\\\(D\\\\) moves?  \\n     - **Max** if we always go *up* by choosing the +1 end of \\\\([2x,2x+1]\\\\) is  \\n       \\\\[\\n         A\\\\,2^D + (2^D -1).\\n       \\\\]\\n     - **Min** if we go *down* as much as possible until we hit 1 and then alternate up/down (never dropping to 0).  \\n       One can show in \\\\(O(1)\\\\) time (using the floor‐shift and parity argument) that we can compute\\n       \\\\[\\n         \\\\text{fmin}(A,D).\\n       \\\\]\\n     If \\\\(C\\\\notin[\\\\text{fmin}(A,D),\\\\,\\\\text{fmax}(A,D)]\\\\), we declare failure.\\n   - Otherwise we **greedily construct** exactly \\\\(D\\\\) steps from \\\\(A\\\\to C\\\\).  At each step we have at most three choices:  \\n     1. **down** \\\\(\\\\lfloor x/2\\\\rfloor\\\\) (if \\\\(\\\\ge1\\\\)),  \\n     2. **up1** \\\\(2x\\\\),  \\n     3. **up2** \\\\(2x+1\\\\) (if \\\\(\\\\le10^9\\\\)).  \\n     We test each candidate in that order, keeping only those from which \\\\(C\\\\) is still reachable in the remaining steps.
