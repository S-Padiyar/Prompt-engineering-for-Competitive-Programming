Alice's Adventures in Cards\n\ntime limit per test2 seconds\n\nmemory limit per test256 megabytes\n\nAlice is playing cards with the Queen of Hearts, King of Hearts, and Jack of Hearts. There are n\n\n different types of cards in their card game. Alice currently has a card of type 1\n\n and needs a card of type n\n\n to escape Wonderland. The other players have one of each kind of card.\n\n\n\nIn this card game, Alice can trade cards with the three other players. Each player has different preferences for the n\n\n types of cards, which can be described by permutations∗\n\n q\n\n, k\n\n, and j\n\n for the Queen, King, and Jack, respectively.\n\n\n\nA player values card a\n\n more than card b\n\n if for their permutation p\n\n, pa>pb\n\n. Then, this player is willing to trade card b\n\n to Alice in exchange for card a\n\n. Alice's preferences are straightforward: she values card a\n\n more than card b\n\n if a>b\n\n, and she will also only trade according to these preferences.\n\n\n\nDetermine if Alice can trade up from card 1\n\n to card n\n\n subject to these preferences, and if it is possible, give a possible set of trades to do it.\n\n\n\n∗\n\nA permutation of length n\n\n is an array consisting of n\n\n distinct integers from 1\n\n to n\n\n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4]\n\n is a permutation, but [1,2,2]\n\n is not a permutation (2\n\n appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4]\n\n is also not a permutation (n=3\n\n but there is 4\n\n in the array).\n\n\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t\n\n (1≤t≤104\n\n). The description of the test cases follows.\n\n\n\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer n\n\n (2≤n≤2⋅105\n\n) — the number of card types.\n\n\n\nThe next three lines contain the preferences of the Queen, King, and Jack respectively. Each of these lines contains n\n\n integers p1,p2,…,pn\n\n (1≤pi≤n\n\n) — a permutation corresponding to the player's preferences.\n\n\n\nThe sum of n\n\n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105\n\n.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, on the first line output a single string \"YES\" or \"NO\" (without the quotes) denoting whether Alice can trade up to card n\n\n.\n\n\n\nIf the first line was \"YES\", then on the next line output k\n\n — the number of trades Alice will make. On the next k\n\n lines output space separated a character c∈{q,k,j}\n\n and integer x\n\n, denoting that Alice trades with player c\n\n to get card x\n\n. It must be the case that on the k\n\n'th line, x=n\n\n. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.\n\n\n\nYou can output this answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\", and \"YES\" will be recognized as positive responses. The same goes for the character c\n\n denoting the player in the trade (Q,K,J\n\n will all be accepted alongside their lowercase variants).\n\n\n\nExample\n\nInputCopy\n\n2\n\n3\n\n1 3 2\n\n2 1 3\n\n1 2 3\n\n4\n\n2 3 1 4\n\n1 2 3 4\n\n1 4 2 3\n\nOutputCopy\n\nYES\n\n2\n\nk 2\n\nq 3\n\nNO\n\nNote\n\nIn the first testcase, Alice can trade with the King to get card 2\n\n. She can then trade with the Queen to get card 3\n\n.\n\n\n\nIn the second testcase, even though Alice can trade with the Queen to get card 3\n\n, with the King to get card 2\n\n, and then with the Jack to get card 4\n\n, this is not a valid solution since it doesn't respect Alice's preferences. We can show that there is no way for Alice to get to card 4\n\n.\n\n---\n\nUse Java."

Alice starts with card \\\\(1\\\\) and wants card \\\\(n\\\\).  She can only trade “up” in her own valuation (she only accepts a card \\\\(x\\\\) if \\\\(x>a\\\\), where \\\\(a\\\\) is the card she currently holds).  The three opponents (Queen, King, Jack) each have a permutation \\\\(p\\\\) of \\\\(\\\\{1,\\\\dots,n\\\\}\\\\) that encodes their ranking: they will give up card \\\\(x\\\\) for card \\\\(a\\\\) if and only if they prefer \\\\(a\\\\) to \\\\(x\\\\), i.e.\\\\ \\\\(p[a]>p[x]\\\\).  \\n\\nHence we get a directed graph on nodes \\\\(\\\\{1,\\\\dots,n\\\\}\\\\).  From node \\\\(a\\\\) there is an edge to node \\\\(x\\\\) (labeled by which opponent we trade with) exactly when\\n\\n 1. \\\\(x>a\\\\)  (Alice must gain a strictly larger card), and  \\n 2. for that opponent \\\\(c\\\\), \\\\(p_c[a]>p_c[x]\\\\).\\n\\nWe want any path from \\\\(1\\\\) to \\\\(n\\\\).  A straightforward BFS/shortest‐path on this graph would be fine, except that there can be \\\\(O(n^2)\\\\) potential edges if we tried to build them all.  \\n\\nInstead, we do a “dynamic” graph‐exploration using three segment‐trees (one per opponent).  Each segment tree lets us maintain the *unvisited* card‐types in a range, keyed by the opponent’s preference value \\\\(p_c[x]\\\\).  When we pop a card \\\\(a\\\\) from our BFS queue, for each opponent \\\\(c\\\\in\\\\{\\\\text{Queen},\\\\text{King},\\\\text{Jack}\\\\}\\\\) we repeatedly ask:\\n\\n  • What is the unvisited card \\\\(x>a\\\\) of *minimum* \\\\(p_c[x]\\\\) in the range \\\\([a+1,n]\\\\)?  \\n  • If that minimum \\\\(p_c[x] < p_c[a]\\\\), we can trade \\\\(a\\\\to x\\\\) with opponent \\\\(c\\\\).  We then mark \\\\(x\\\\) visited, record how we got there, remove \\\\(x\\\\) from *all* three segment‐trees, and enqueue \\\\(x\\\\).  \\n  • Keep repeating until no more \\\\(x\\\\) in \\\\([a+1,n]\\\\) satisfy \\\\(p_c[x]<p_c[a]\\\\).\\n\\nBecause each card (node) is visited exactly once, this loop in total does \\\\(O(n)\\\\) removals, each removal and each segment‐tree query/update takes \\\\(O(\\\\log n)\\\\).  Thus the overall is \\\\(O(n\\\\log n)\\\\) per test, which is easily fast for \\\\(\\\\sum n\\\\le2\\\\cdot10^5\\\\).  \\n\\nIf at the end card \\\\(n\\\\) is visited, we reconstruct the path by standard BFS parent‐pointer reversal.\\n\\n---\\n\\n```java\\nimport java.io.*;\\nimport java.util.*;\\n\\npublic class Main {\\n    static final int INF = Integer.MAX_VALUE;\\n\\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\\n        FastReader in = new FastReader();\\n        PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(System.out);\\n\\n        int t = in.nextInt();\\n        while (t-- > 0) {\\n            int n = in.nextInt();\\n            // Read the three permutations p[0]=Queen, p[1]=King, p[2]=Jack\\n            int[][] p = new int[3][n+1];\\n            for (int c = 0; c < 3; c++) {\\n                for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\\n                    p[c][i] = in.nextInt();\\n                }\\n            }\\n\\n            // Build three segment-trees, each over [1..n], storing (minPrefValue, position).\\n            SegTree[] seg = new SegTree[3];\\n            for (int c = 0; c < 3; c++) {\\n                seg[c] = new SegTree(n);\\n                seg[c].build(1, 1, n, p[c]);\\n            }\\n\\n            // BFS structures\\n            boolean[] visited = new boolean[n+1];\\n            int[] parent = new int[n+1];    // predecessor in the BFS tree\\n            int[] how = new int[n+1];       // which opponent (0,1,2) we traded with to get here\\n\\n            // Start BFS from card 1\\n            Deque<Integer> queue = new ArrayDeque<>();\\n            visited[1] = true;\\n            // remove card 1 from all segment-trees\\n            for (int c = 0; c < 3; c++) {\\n                seg[c].update(1, 1, n, 1, INF);\\n            }\\n            queue.add(1);\\n\\n            while (!queue.isEmpty()) {\\n                int a = queue.poll();\\n                if (a == n) break; // already reached n\\n                // For each opponent c, try to find all x > a with p[c][x] < p[c][a].\\n                for (int c = 0; c < 3; c++) {\\n                    while (true) {\\n                        // query the minimum p[c][x] in the range [a+1..n]\\n                        if (a+1 > n) break;\\n                        Pair best = seg[c].query(1, 1, n, a+1, n);\\n                        if (best.pref >= p[c][a]) break; // no more valid trades with this c\\n                        int x = best.pos;\\n                        // visit x\\n                        visited[x] = true;\\n                        parent[x] = a;\\n                        how[x] = c; // we got to x by trading with opponent c\\n                        queue.add(x);\\n                        // remove x from all three segment-trees so we never revisit\\n                        for (int d = 0; d < 3; d++) {\\n                            seg[d].update(1, 1, n, x, INF);\\n                        }\\n                    }\\n                }\\n            }\\n\\n            if (!visited[n]) {\\n                out.println(\\\"NO\\\");\\n            } else {\\n                // Reconstruct path from 1 to n\\n                List<Pair> path = new ArrayList<>();\\n                int cur = n;\\n                while (cur != 1) {\\n                    path.add(new Pair(how[cur], cur));\\n                    cur = parent[cur];\\n                }\\n                Collections.reverse(path);\\n\\n                out.println(\\\"YES\\\");\\n                out.println(path.size());\\n                for (Pair step : path) {\\n                    char who = (step.pref==0 ?

From node \\\\(a\\\\) there is a directed edge to \\\\(x\\\\) if and only if  \\n   - \\\\(x>a\\\\) (Alice only trades up), and  \\n   - the opponent \\\\(c\\\\) we choose satisfies \\\\(p_c[a]>p_c[x]\\\\) (they prefer Alice’s \\\\(a\\\\) to their \\\\(x\\\\)).\\n\\n2. **Implicit Edges via Segment Trees**  \\n   Rather than explicitly build up to \\\\(O(n^2)\\\\) edges, we do a BFS from node \\\\(1\\\\).  Whenever we dequeue a node \\\\(a\\\\), for each opponent \\\\(c\\\\) we want *all* nodes \\\\(x>a\\\\) with \\\\(p_c[x]<p_c[a]\\\\).  We maintain a segment‐tree over the card‐ids \\\\([1..n]\\\\), storing the *minimum* \\\\(p_c[x]\\\\) in each range and the position of that minimum.  We also keep *only unvisited* cards in that tree (visited cards are “deleted” by setting their preference to \\\\(+\\\\infty\\\\)).\\n\\n   Thus we can in \\\\(O(\\\\log n)\\\\) find the smallest \\\\(p_c[x]\\\\) in \\\\([a+1..n]\\\\).  If it is below \\\\(p_c[a]\\\\), we know that particular \\\\(x\\\\) is tradeable, we visit it, enqueue it, and delete it from all three trees.  We repeat until no more valid \\\\(x\\\\) remain for that opponent.  Since each node is deleted once, the total work is \\\\(O(n\\\\log n)\\\\).\\n\\n3. **Reconstruction**  \\n   We keep `parent[x]` = the node we came from, and `how[x]` = which opponent (\\\\(0,1,2\\\\) for q/k/j).  Once we reach node \\\\(n\\\\), we back‐track to \\\\(1\\\\) and output the trades in order.\\n\\nThis runs in \\\\(O(n\\\\log n)\\\\) per test, and the sum of \\\\(n\\\\) over all tests is up to \\\\(2\\\\cdot10^5\\\\), so it easily fits under the 2-second limit.\",\n        \"refusal\": null,\n        \"role\": \"assistant\",\n        \"annotations\": [],\n        \"audio\": null,\n        \"function_call\": null,\n        \"tool_calls\": null\n      },\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"protected_material_code\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": true,\n          \"citation\": {\n            \"URL\": \"https://github.com/ayoub62/letscode3/tree/2a026d6a39f1bf21c16913e1b11507bd9a1fee38/Space.java\",\n            \"license\": \"NOASSERTION\"\n          }\n        },\n        \"protected_material_text\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"created\": 1753309900,\n  \"model\": \"o4-mini-2025-04-16\",\n  \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n  \"service_tier\": null,\n  \"system_fingerprint\": null,\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"completion_tokens\": 6370,\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 881,\n    \"total_tokens\": 7251,\n    \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n      \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"reasoning_tokens\": 3712,\n      \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n    },\n    \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"cached_tokens\": 0\n    }\n  },\n  \"prompt_filter_results\": [\n    {\n      \"prompt_index\": 0,\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"jailbreak\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
