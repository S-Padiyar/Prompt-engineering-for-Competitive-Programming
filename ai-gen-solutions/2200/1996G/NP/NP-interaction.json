We must choose a subset $M$ of the cycle–edges (\\\"maintained roads\\\") so that for each friendship $(a,b)$ there is *some* path in $M$ connecting $a$ to $b$.  Equivalently, on the cycle there are two ways to go from $a$ to $b$ (the \\\"clockwise\\\" arc and the \\\"counterclockwise\\\" arc), and we must choose *one* of these two arcs for each friendship—and take *all* edges of that arc into our maintained set.  Our goal is to minimize the total number of maintained edges, counting overlaps only once.\\n\\nA nice observation (standard in \\\"Steiner‐forest‐on‐a‐cycle\\\" problems) is that if you *cut* the cycle at some edge $k$ (i.e. remove edge $k$), you turn it into a path.  On that path, *every* friendship has exactly one path between its ends (whichever circle‐arc did *not* include edge $k$), so that arc is forced.  Thus for each possible cut‐edge $k\\\\in\\\\{1,2,\\\\dots,n\\\\}$ we can\\n\\n 1. remove all friendships whose *clockwise* arc contains $k$, and for each of those take the *counterclockwise* arc instead;\\n 2. for the other friendships (whose clockwise arc does *not* contain $k$) keep the clockwise arc;\\n 3. take the union of all chosen arcs – that is exactly the set of edges we must maintain if we cut at $k$,\\n 4. measure its size $L_k$,\\n 5. and finally choose the best $k$ that minimizes $L_k$.\\n\\nSince $n,m\\\\le2\\\\cdot10^5$ overall, we cannot for each $k$ separately recompute a big union from scratch.  Instead we do a single **sweep** over $k=1\\\\ldots n$ in $O((n+m)\\\\log n)$ time with a segment‐tree that maintains the *current* union‐size of all chosen intervals, supporting\\n\\n- range‐add $+1$ or $-1$ to indicate inserting or deleting an interval,\\n- and a query of “how many positions have coverage $\\\\ge1$.”\\n\\nWe do this:\\n\\n1.  **Label each friendship** $i$ with  \\n    - its *clockwise* arc (which on the cycle is always the interval of edges \\n      \\\\[\\n         [\\\\,a_i,\\\\;b_i-1\\\\,]\\n      \\\\]\\n      since $a_i<b_i$)  \\n    - and its *counterclockwise* arc, which is the complementary wrap‐around interval\\n      \\\\[\\n         [\\\\,b_i,n\\\\,]\\\\;\\\\cup\\\\;[\\\\,1,a_i-1\\\\,].\\n      \\\\]\\n      This may split into at most two linear intervals on $[1..n]$.\\n\\n2.  We will keep in the segment tree the **union** of exactly one arc per friendship:  \\n    - initially (before any cut) we assume **all** friendships use their *clockwise* arc, so we bulk‐add (+1) the segment $[a_i,b_i-1]$ for every $i$.  \\n    - now we sweep $k=1,2,\\\\dots,n$.  Each time $k$ passes from $k-1$ to $k$, those friendships whose clockwise‐arc *begins* at $k$ (i.e.\\\\ $a_i=k$) become *active*—we must “switch” them from clockwise‐interval to counterclockwise.  Likewise those whose removal point is $k$ (i.e.\\\\ $b_i=k$) become inactive (switch back).\\n\\n   Concretely at an event for friendship $i$ with delta $+1$ (entering active set) we do\\n\\n     – **remove** its clockwise range by range‐add $-1$,  \\n     – **add** its counterclockwise ranges by range‐add $+1$.  \\n\\n   And on a delta $-1$ event we undo that:\\n\\n     – **remove** counterclockwise by $-1$,  \\n     – **add** clockwise by $+1$.\\n\\n3.  After processing all events at position $k$, the segment‐tree knows how many edges among $\\\\{1,\\\\dots,n\\\\}$ are currently covered by at least one chosen interval.  But *by construction* none of the active counterclockwise arcs nor the remaining clockwise arcs will cover the *cut* edge $k$, so the segment‐tree’s “covered‐count” is exactly $L_k$, the total number of *maintained* edges when we cut at $k$.  \\n\\n4.  We keep $\\\\min_k L_k$ and output that.\\n\\nOverall each friendship produces just two events ($+1$ at $a_i$, $-1$ at $b_i$), each event causes up to three range‐updates (one for the clockwise interval, two for the wrap in counterclockwise).  Each update is $O(\\\\log n)$ in a lazy segment‐tree; sweeping all $k=1..n$ is $O(n+m)$ events.  Thus $O((n+m)\\\\log n)$ total per test, which fits easily in 3 s for $n,m\\\\le2\\\\cdot10^5$.\\n\\n---\\n\\n```java\\nimport java.io.*;\\nimport java.util.*;\\n\\npublic class Main {\\n    static final int MAX = 200000;

We label each friendship \\\\(i\\\\) by  \\n   *clockwise* interval  \\n     \\\\[\\n        [\\\\,a_i,\\\\;b_i-1\\\\,]\\n     \\\\]  \\n   (which never wraps since \\\\(a_i<b_i\\\\) in input),  \\n   and *counterclockwise* (its complement on the cycle), which *may* wrap:  \\n     \\\\[\\n       [b_i,n]\\\\;\\\\cup\\\\;[1,a_i-1].\\n     \\\\]\\n\\n2. We choose a “cut‐edge” \\\\(k\\\\).  Any friendship whose clockwise‐arc covers \\\\(k\\\\) must use the counterclockwise arc instead (so that the cut edge \\\\(k\\\\) is out of the maintained set).  All others use their clockwise arc.\\n\\n3. We sweep \\\\(k=1,2,\\\\dots,n\\\\).  We maintain in a segment‐tree over edges \\\\(\\\\{1,\\\\dots,n\\\\}\\\\) the *current* union of intervals, exactly one per friendship, by *range‐adding* \\\\(+1\\\\) when we insert an interval and \\\\(-1\\\\) when we delete it.  The segment‐tree stores, for each position, the *cover‐count*; from that it also keeps how many positions are at count \\\\(0\\\\) versus \\\\(\\\\ge1\\\\).  \\n\\n4.  Initially (before \\\\(k=1\\\\)) we assume *all* friendships use their *clockwise* arcs, so we bulk‐add them all.  Then at \\\\(k\\\\) we have two kinds of events:\\n\\n   - **enter** event \\\\((i,+1)\\\\) at \\\\(k=a_i\\\\): friendship \\\\(i\\\\) becomes active ⇒ remove its clockwise arc (–1) and add its counterclockwise piece(s) (+1).  \\n   - **exit** event \\\\((i,-1)\\\\) at \\\\(k=b_i\\\\): reverse that operation.\\n\\n5.  After processing events at each \\\\(k\\\\), the tree’s “covered count” = #edges with coverage ≥1 is exactly the number of roads maintained if we cut at \\\\(k\\\\).  We take the minimum over all \\\\(k\\\\).\\n\\nTime is \\\\(O((n+m)\\\\log n)\\\\) per test, which safely handles \\\\(n,m\\\\) up to \\\\(2\\\\times10^5\\\\).\",\n        \"refusal\": null,\n        \"role\": \"assistant\",\n        \"annotations\": [],\n        \"audio\": null,\n        \"function_call\": null,\n        \"tool_calls\": null\n      },\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"protected_material_code\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"protected_material_text\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"created\": 1753310362,\n  \"model\": \"o4-mini-2025-04-16\",\n  \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n  \"service_tier\": null,\n  \"system_fingerprint\": null,\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"completion_tokens\": 18578,\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 514,\n    \"total_tokens\": 19092,\n    \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n      \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"reasoning_tokens\": 15104,\n      \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n    },\n    \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"cached_tokens\": 0\n    }\n  },\n  \"prompt_filter_results\": [\n    {\n      \"prompt_index\": 0,\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"jailbreak\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
