**Problem Restatement**

We have two directed graphs \(G_1\) and \(G_2\), each with \(n\) vertices, strongly connected, and every cycle in each is of length divisible by \(k\).  Each vertex in each graph is labeled either *outgoing* or *incoming*.  We wish to add exactly \(n\) new directed edges *across* the two graphs (so no new edge stays in the same graph) so that:

1. Each *outgoing* vertex issues exactly one of the new edges.
2. Each *incoming* vertex receives exactly one of the new edges.
3. In the combined graph (the union of \(G_1\), \(G_2\), and the new edges), every directed cycle has length divisible by \(k\).

We must decide if such a selection of \(n\) cross-edges is possible.

---

**Key Observations**

1.  Let
   \[
     X_1 = \#\{\text{outgoing vertices in }G_1\},\quad
     Y_1 = \#\{\text{incoming vertices in }G_1\},
   \]
   and similarly
   \[
     X_2 = \#\{\text{outgoing in }G_2\},\quad
     Y_2 = \#\{\text{incoming in }G_2\}.
   \]
   Since each outgoing must send exactly one new edge, the total number of outgoing vertices across both graphs is
   \[
     X_1 + X_2 \;=\;\text{(number of new edges)} \;=\; n.
   \]
   Likewise by the “one incoming edge per incoming vertex” condition one checks automatically \(Y_1 + Y_2 = n\).  
   Hence a necessary condition is
   \[
     (X_1 + X_2 = n).
   \]

2.  **Cycle‐length constraint:**  
    Any new cycle in the combined graph alternates some new (cross) edges with paths inside \(G_1\) or \(G_2\).  Because each path inside \(G_i\) has length \(\equiv 0\pmod{k}\), the only way a cycle can fail the divisibility‐by‐\(k\) test is if the number of *new* edges it uses, call it \(t\), is not divisible by \(k\).

    Moreover, a classical “strong‐connectivity plus cycle‐length‐mod‐\(k\)” argument shows that from any cross‐edge’s endpoint you can go to *any* next cross‐edge’s start (within the same graph) with a path of length \(\equiv 0\pmod{k}\).  Hence in effect the cross‐edges alone generate a *complete bipartite* “step graph” between the outgoing sets of \(G_1\) and \(G_2\).  Such a complete bipartite digraph always has directed 2‐cycles (pick one outgoing in \(G_1\), one in \(G_2\)), so unless \(k\mid 2\) (i.e.\ \(k=2\)) these 2‐cycles violate the “cycle‐length divisible by \(k\)” requirement.

3.  **Corner cases:**  
    - If \(k=2\), then every even cycle is fine, and these 2‐cycles are allowed.  So *as long as* \(X_1+X_2=n\), the answer is YES.  
    - If \(k>2\), then 2‐cycles force us to disallow *any* mixing of outgoing vertices across the two graphs.  In particular, we can only avoid building any cross‐graph 2‐cycle if all new edges go *in the same direction* (i.e.\ all from \(G_1\to G_2\) or all from \(G_2\to G_1\)), which happens precisely when one of \(X_1\) or \(X_2\) is zero.  

Putting together:

- First check \(X_1 + X_2 = n\).  If not, print NO.
- Else if \(k = 2\), print YES.
- Else (\(k>2\)), print YES *only if* \(X_1=0\) or \(X_2=0\); otherwise NO.

In fact **no** information about the internal edges of \(G_1\) or \(G_2\) is needed beyond strong connectivity and the “all cycles \(\equiv0\pmod k\)” guarantee, so we can skip reading them beyond discarding input lines.

---

**Complexities**

- Time: \(O\bigl(\sum n + \sum (m_1+m_2)\bigr)\) for input reading.  The decision logic per test is \(O(n+m_1+m_2)\), but the graph edges are never stored nor processed further.  
- Space: \(O(n)\) for reading the two bit-arrays \(a\) and \(b\).  We do not store edges.

**Explanation of Key Steps**

1.  We count `sumA =` number of 1’s in the first label array (outgoing in \(G_1\)) and `sumB =` likewise for \(G_2\).
2.  We skip over the descriptions of the original edges in each graph, since they carry no further role in our distilled criterion.
3.  We verify  
    a) `sumA + sumB == n` (necessary to have exactly \(n\) new edges, one from each outgoing).  
    b) If \(k=2\), every formed cycle will have even length, so the “cycle‐divisible‐by‐\(k\)” requirement is automatically satisfied.  
    c) If \(k>2\), we must avoid the existence of any 2‐cycle formed by a new edge from \(G_1\to G_2\) and one from \(G_2\to G_1\).  The only way to forbid *all* such 2‐cycles is to have *all* cross‐edges point in the same direction; equivalently, one of the graphs must contribute zero outgoings (i.e.\ `sumA == 0` or `sumB == 0`).

This runs in \(O(\sum n + \sum m)\) time for input handling and constant‐time logic per test.
