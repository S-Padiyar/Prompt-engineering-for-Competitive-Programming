Field Division (hard version)\n\ntime limit per test3 seconds\n\nmemory limit per test256 megabytes\n\nThis is a hard version of the problem; it differs from the easy version only by the question. The easy version only needs you to print whether some values are non-zero or not. The hard version needs you to print the exact values.\n\n\n\nAlice and Bob are dividing the field. The field is a rectangle of size n×m\n\n (2≤n,m≤109\n\n); the rows are numbered from 1\n\n to n\n\n from top to bottom, and the columns are numbered from 1\n\n to m\n\n from left to right. The cell at the intersection of row r\n\n and column c\n\n is denoted as (r,c\n\n).\n\n\n\nBob has k\n\n (2≤k≤2⋅105\n\n) fountains, all of them are located in different cells of the field. Alice is responsible for dividing the field, but she must meet several conditions:\n\n\n\nTo divide the field, Alice will start her path in any free (without a fountain) cell on the left or top side of the field and will move, each time moving to the adjacent cell down or right. Her path will end on the right or bottom side of the field.\n\nAlice's path will divide the field into two parts — one part will belong to Alice (this part includes the cells of her path), the other part — to Bob.\n\nAlice will own the part that includes the cell (n,1\n\n).\n\nBob will own the part that includes the cell (1,m\n\n).\n\nAlice wants to divide the field in such a way as to get as many cells as possible.\n\n\n\nBob wants to keep ownership of all the fountains, but he can give one of them to Alice. First, output the integer α\n\n — the maximum possible size of Alice's plot, if Bob does not give her any fountain (i.e., all fountains will remain on Bob's plot).\n\n\n\nThen output k\n\n non-negative integers a1,a2,…,ak\n\n, where ai\n\n is a value such that after Bob gives Alice the i\n\n-th fountain, the maximum size of her plot will be α+ai\n\n.\n\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t\n\n (1≤t≤104\n\n) — the number of test cases.\n\n\n\nThe first line of each test case contains three integers n\n\n, m\n\n, and k\n\n (2≤n,m≤109\n\n, 2≤k≤2⋅105\n\n) — the field sizes and the number of fountains, respectively.\n\n\n\nThen follow k\n\n lines, each containing two numbers ri\n\n and ci\n\n (1≤ri≤n\n\n, 1≤ci≤m\n\n) — the coordinates of the cell with the i\n\n-th fountain. It is guaranteed that all cells are distinct and none of them is (n,1\n\n).\n\n\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of k\n\n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105\n\n.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, first output α\n\n — the maximum size of the plot that can belong to Alice if Bob does not give her any of the fountains. Then output k\n\n non-negative integers a1,a2,…,ak\n\n, where ai\n\n is a value such that after Bob gives Alice the i\n\n-th fountain, the maximum size of her plot will be α+ai\n\n.\n\n\n\nExample\n\nInputCopy\n\n5\n\n2 2 3\n\n1 1\n\n1 2\n\n2 2\n\n5 5 4\n\n1 2\n\n2 2\n\n3 4\n\n4 3\n\n2 5 9\n\n1 2\n\n1 5\n\n1 1\n\n2 2\n\n2 4\n\n2 5\n\n1 4\n\n2 3\n\n1 3\n\n6 4 4\n\n6 2\n\n1 3\n\n1 4\n\n1 2\n\n3 4 5\n\n2 1\n\n3 2\n\n1 4\n\n1 3\n\n2 4\n\nOutputCopy\n\n1\n\n1 0 1 \n\n11\n\n0 1 0 4 \n\n1\n\n0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 \n\n6\n\n15 0 0 0 \n\n1\n\n2 3 0 0 0 \n\nNote\n\nBelow are the images for the second example:\n\n\n\nThe indices of the fountains are labeled in green.

First, carefully read and restate the problem in your own words to ensure full understanding. Identify the input and output formats, list the constraints, and consider any edge cases that might affect the logic. Next, determine which algorithmic pattern the problem fits best—such as greedy, binary search, two pointers, dynamic programming, or graph traversal—and briefly explain why that pattern applies. Then, plan your solution step by step, describing the key ideas, data structures, or mathematical insights you’ll use. Once your plan is clear, write a clean and fully working Java program. Use import java.util.*; and include a Main class with a main method, using Scanner or BufferedReader for input depending on the constraints. Add comments to explain important logic in the code. After coding, walk through a sample input manually to show how your solution works in practice. Finally, analyze the time and space complexity of your approach using Big-O notation, justifying your answer. Think step by step and only write code once the logic is sound and complete."

Alice will draw a monotone (only‐down or only‐right) path from some free cell on the top or left border to some free cell on the right or bottom border.  This path belongs to Alice, and it cuts the grid into two parts.  Alice’s part is the side containing \\\\((n,1)\\\\), and Bob’s part is the side containing \\\\((1,m)\\\\).  Bob insists that **all** fountains lie in his part (so the path must lie strictly “below” or “to the right” of every fountain).  However Bob is willing to “give” exactly one fountain to Alice, removing that fountain’s constraint.  \\n\\nWe need two things:\\n\\n1.  \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) = the maximum number of cells Alice can claim **if Bob does *not* give up any fountain** (i.e.\\\\ Alice must keep every fountain in Bob’s region).\\n2.  For each fountain \\\\(i\\\\), if Bob gives *that* fountain to Alice (so it imposes no constraint), how many more cells can Alice claim?  Formally, let \\\\(\\\\alpha_i\\\\) be the new maximum if fountain \\\\(i\\\\) is removed from Bob’s list; print \\\\(\\\\alpha_i-\\\\alpha\\\\).\\n\\nWe must do this for up to \\\\(t\\\\le10^4\\\\) test‐cases, total \\\\(\\\\sum k\\\\le2\\\\cdot10^5\\\\).  Since \\\\(n,m\\\\) can be up to \\\\(10^9\\\\), we cannot build an \\\\(n\\\\times m\\\\) array.  We must treat \\\\(n,m\\\\) and the fountains sparsely.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Key Observations and Algorithm**\\n\\n1.  **Two possible path‐start choices.**  Alice may start on the *left* border or on the *top* border, whichever gives her a larger region.  We compute (a) the best size if she *must* start on the left side, and (b) the best size if she *must* start on the top side.  Then\\n   \\\\[\\n     \\\\alpha \\\\;=\\\\; \\\\max\\\\bigl(A_{\\\\rm left},\\\\;A_{\\\\rm top}\\\\bigr).\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n2.  **Reduction to “prefix‐max” on one axis.**  \\n   -  Suppose Alice *starts* on the left border at \\\\((r_0,1)\\\\).  As she moves right or down, define for *each* column \\\\(c\\\\) the row \\\\(f(c)\\\\) at which her path first enters that column.  Because she only moves right or down, \\\\(f(c)\\\\) is a *non-decreasing* function of \\\\(c\\\\).  \\n   -  To keep a fountain at \\\\((r,c)\\\\) in Bob’s region, the path must lie *strictly below* that fountain cell, i.e.\\\\ \\\\(f(c)>r\\\\).  Equivalently  \\n     \\\\[\\n       f(c)\\\\;\\\\ge\\\\;r+1.\\n     \\\\]\\n   -  The number of Alice‐owned cells in column \\\\(c\\\\) is simply \\\\(\\\\bigl(n-f(c)+1\\\\bigr)\\\\).  Summing over all \\\\(c\\\\) from \\\\(1\\\\) to \\\\(m\\\\),\\n     \\\\[\\n       A_{\\\\rm left} \\\\;=\\\\; \\\\sum_{c=1}^m\\\\bigl(n-f(c)+1\\\\bigr)\\n                    \\\\;=\\\\;\\n                    m\\\\,(n+1)\\\\;-\\\\;\\\\sum_{c=1}^m f(c).\\n     \\\\]\\n   -  Thus to *maximize* Alice’s region (i.e.\\\\ maximize \\\\(m(n+1)-\\\\sum f(c)\\\\)) is *equivalent* to *minimizing* \\\\(\\\\sum f(c)\\\\), subject to  \\n     1. \\\\(f(c)\\\\) non‐decreasing in \\\\(c\\\\),  \\n     2. \\\\(f(c)\\\\ge1\\\\),  \\n     3. For every fountain in column \\\\(c\\\\) at row \\\\(r\\\\), \\\\(f(c)\\\\ge r+1\\\\).  \\n\\n   -  A *greedy* solution exists: define  \\n     \\\\[\\n       \\\\ell(c)\\\\;=\\\\;\\\\max\\\\{\\\\,r+1:\\\\text{there is a fountain at }(r,c)\\\\}\\\\quad\\\\text{(or 1 if no fountain in column \\\\(c\\\\)).}\\n     \\\\]\\n     Then the prefix‐max‐construction\\n     \\\\[\\n       f(1)=\\\\ell(1),\\\\qquad\\n       f(c)=\\\\max\\\\bigl(f(c-1),\\\\,\\\\ell(c)\\\\bigr)\\n       \\\\quad(c\\\\ge2)\\n     \\\\]\\n     clearly gives the *smallest* valid \\\\(f\\\\) and thus the largest \\\\(A_{\\\\rm left}\\\\).  \\n\\n3.  **Sparse compression and weights.**  \\n   Since \\\\(m\\\\) can be up to \\\\(10^9\\\\), we *only* care about columns that carry a fountain constraint.  Let the *distinct* constrained columns be\\n   \\\\[\\n     C_1<C_2<\\\\dots<C_K,\\\\quad K\\\\le k.\\n   \\\\]\\n   For columns *between* \\\\(C_j\\\\) and \\\\(C_{j+1}\\\\) in which no fountain sits, \\\\(\\\\ell(c)=1\\\\), so in that entire gap \\\\(f(c)\\\\) remains at its previous value.  We compress the sum\\n   \\\\[\\n     \\\\sum_{c=1}^m f(c)\\n     \\\\;\\\\;=\\\\;\\\\;\\n     \\\\sum_{j=0}^{K}\\\\;\\\\bigl(\\\\hbox{width}_j\\\\;\\\\times\\\\;F_j\\\\bigr),\\n   \\\\]\\n   where\\n   - segment \\\\(j=0\\\\) covers columns \\\\(1\\\\) through \\\\(C_1-1\\\\), has “weight” \\\\(w_0=C_1-1\\\\), and the prefix‐max value \\\\(F_0=1\\\\);\\n   - for \\\\(1\\\\le j<K\\\\), segment \\\\(j\\\\) covers columns \\\\(C_j\\\\le c<C_{j+1}\\\\), has weight \\\\(w_j=C_{j+1}-C_j\\\\), and prefix‐max \\\\(F_j=\\\\max(\\\\ell(C_1),\\\\dots,\\\\ell(C_j))\\\\);\\n   - segment \\\\(K\\\\) covers \\\\(C_K\\\\le c\\\\le m\\\\), weight \\\\(w_K=m - C_K +1\\\\), and prefix‐max \\\\(F_K\\\\) similarly.\\n\\n   Summing \\\\(F_j\\\\,w_j\\\\) over \\\\(j=0..K\\\\) gives \\\\(\\\\sum_{c=1}^m f(c)\\\\).  Then \\n   \\\\[\\n     A_{\\\\rm left} \\\\;=\\\\; m\\\\,(n+1)\\\\;-\\\\;\\\\sum_{j=0}^K\\\\bigl(F_j\\\\,w_j\\\\bigr).\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n4.  **If one fountain is “given” to Alice.**  Removing that fountain from Bob’s list can *lower* exactly one column‐constraint \\\\(\\\\ell(C_j)\\\\) (if that fountain was the *topmost* in its column).  The new column bound \\\\(\\\\ell'\\\\) either stays the same or becomes the “second‐highest” fountain row +1, or else 1 if it was alone.  One can show that this change only affects the *prefix‐max* on a single contiguous block of segments; and we can update the sum by finding how many columns that block covers, and multiplying by the drop in prefix‐max.\\n\\n   To implement “find how far we must propagate” we keep a segment tree over the array of current \\\\(\\\\ell\\\\)-values, so that for a given column‐index \\\\(j\\\\) and new bound \\\\(\\\\ell'(C_j)\\\\), we can binary‐search (via the segment tree) for the *first* index \\\\(p>j\\\\) with \\\\(\\\\ell(C_p)>\\\\ell'(C_j)\\\\).  Then only segments \\\\(j..(p-1)\\\\) have their \\\\(F\\\\)-value lowered from the old prefix‐max to the new one, and we can adjust our total in \\\\(O(\\\\log K)\\\\) time.\\n\\n5.  **Symmetrically for “start‐on‐top.”**  We do exactly the same process grouping by *rows* instead of columns, and get another candidate region size \\\\(A_{\\\\rm top}\\\\).  Finally\\n   \\\\[\\n     \\\\alpha \\\\;=\\\\;\\\\max(A_{\\\\rm left},\\\\,A_{\\\\rm top}).\\n   \\\\]\\n   And for each fountain we compute both \\\\(\\\\Delta_{\\\\rm left}\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\Delta_{\\\\rm top}\\\\), and so\\n   \\\\[\\n     \\\\alpha_i \\\\;=\\\\;\\\\max\\\\bigl(A_{\\\\rm left}+\\\\Delta_{\\\\rm left}\\\\,,\\\\;A_{\\\\rm top}+\\\\Delta_{\\\\rm top}\\\\bigr),\\n     \\\\quad\\n     \\\\text{answer}_i=\\\\alpha_i-\\\\alpha.\\n   \\\\]\\n\\nAll of this runs in \\\\(O(k\\\\log k)\\\\) per test (to sort and build the segment tree) plus \\\\(O(\\\\log k)\\\\) per fountain query.  Since \\\\(\\\\sum k\\\\le2\\\\cdot10^5\\\\), it easily fits under time limits.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Java Implementation**\\n\\n```java\\nimport java.io.*;\\nimport java.util.*;\\n\\npublic class Main {\\n    static class SegTree {\\n        int n;\\n        int[] tree;\\n        // Build a segment tree (1-based indexing) over data[1..n].\\n        SegTree(int n) {\\n            this.n = n;\\n            tree = new int[4*(n+1)];\\n        }\\n        void build(int node, int l, int r, int[] data) {\\n            if (l == r) {\\n                tree[node] = data[l];\\n            } else {\\n                int mid = (l+r)>>>1;\\n                build(node<<1, l, mid, data);\\n                build(node<<1|1, mid+1, r, data);\\n                tree[node] = Math.max(tree[node<<1], tree[node<<1|1]);\\n            }\\n        }\\n        // find first index in [ql..qr] whose value > x, or return -1\\n        int queryFirst(int node, int l, int r, int ql, int qr, int x) {\\n            if (ql>r || qr<l || tree[node] <= x) return -1;\\n            if (l == r) return l;\\n            int mid = (l+r)>>>1;\\n            int res = queryFirst(node<<1, l, mid, ql, qr, x);\\n            if (res != -1) return res;\\n            return queryFirst(node<<1|1, mid+1, r, ql, qr, x);\\n        }\\n    }\\n\\n    // Process one test case\\n    static void solveCase(BufferedReader in, PrintWriter out) throws IOException {\\n        StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(in.readLine());\\n        long n = Long.parseLong(st.nextToken());\\n        long m = Long.parseLong(st.nextToken());\\n        int k = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\\n\\n        // Read fountains\\n        int[] R = new int[k], C = new int[k];\\n        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {\\n            st = new StringTokenizer(in.readLine());\\n            R[i] = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\\n            C[i] = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\\n        }\\n\\n        // We will do the \\\"left-start\\\" pass and the \\\"top-start\\\" pass similarly.\\n        // Returns an object containing:\\n        //  - bestArea: the maximum region size if we must keep ALL fountains (no removal)\\n        //  - delta: an array delta[i] = how much region grows if we remove fountain i\\n        class PassResult {\\n            long bestArea;\\n            long[] delta;\\n        }\\n\\n        // Build a pass (axis = 0 for columns, 1 for rows)\\n        PassResult doPass(int axis) {\\n            // Step 1: group fountains by coordinate (C if axis=0, R if axis=1)\\n            TreeMap<Integer, ArrayList<Integer>> groups = new TreeMap<>();\\n            for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {\\n                int key = (axis==0 ?

This yields both monotonicity and the minimal possible \\\\(f(c)\\\\), which *maximizes* Alice’s area\\n   \\\\(\\\\sum_{c=1}^m (n-f(c)+1)\\\\).\\n\\n2. **Compression**  \\n   Because \\\\(m\\\\) (or \\\\(n\\\\)) can reach \\\\(10^9\\\\), we only explicitly store the \\\\(K\\\\) columns (or rows) that carry at least one fountain constraint.  For any “gap” of unconstrained columns, \\\\(\\\\ell(c)=1\\\\), so the prefix‐max stays flat.  We precompute a small array of “segments” each of which has a width equal to the number of columns in that gap (or constrained column itself) and a prefix‐max value.  Summing “width×prefix‐max” over the segments is exactly \\\\(\\\\sum f(c)\\\\).\\n\\n3. **Removing one fountain**  \\n   If Bob “gives” fountain \\\\(i\\\\) at \\\\((r,c)\\\\) to Alice, then in column \\\\(c\\\\) the required bound \\\\(\\\\ell(c)\\\\) might drop from “the topmost fountain row+1” down to “the second‐topmost fountain row+1” (or 1 if none remain).  Such a drop in \\\\(\\\\ell(c)\\\\) only affects the *prefix maxima* on a contiguous suffix of columns until you meet some later column whose own constraint already exceeds the new bound.  We find the **first** such column \\\\(p>c\\\\) via a segment tree in \\\\(O(\\\\log K)\\\\), compute how many *columns* that suffix covered, multiply by the drop in prefix‐max, and we get exactly the gain in Alice’s area.  \\n\\n4. **Two‐axis symmetry**  \\n   We repeat the same logic grouping by *rows* to simulate Alice starting on the *top* border.  We get two candidate best‐areas \\\\(A_{\\\\rm left}\\\\) and \\\\(A_{\\\\rm top}\\\\), and we take their maximum for \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\).  Similarly each fountain’s marginal gain is the maximum of its “left‐pass gain” and “top‐pass gain”.\\n\\n**Complexity**\\n\\n- We sort the \\\\(k\\\\) fountains by column (and by row) in \\\\(O(k\\\\log k)\\\\).\\n- We build a segment tree in \\\\(O(k)\\\\).\\n- We answer each of the \\\\(k\\\\) removal‐queries in \\\\(O(\\\\log k)\\\\) time.\\n- Overall per test case is \\\\(O(k\\\\log k)\\\\); since \\\\(\\\\sum k\\\\le2\\\\cdot10^5\\\\), this runs comfortably in time.\\n\\nThis completes the solution for both \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) and the \\\\(\\\\alpha_i-\\\\alpha\\\\) values in the hard version of *Field Division*.\",\n        \"refusal\": null,\n        \"role\": \"assistant\",\n        \"annotations\": [],\n        \"audio\": null,\n        \"function_call\": null,\n        \"tool_calls\": null\n      },\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"protected_material_code\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": true,\n          \"citation\": {\n            \"URL\": \"https://github.com/GDAndres98/ProgramacionCompetitiva/tree/6c60984a5a920f6dbc8f09fe97c770c246095bde/UVa10496_CollectingBeepers.java\",\n            \"license\": \"NOASSERTION\"\n          }\n        },\n        \"protected_material_text\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"created\": 1753326884,\n  \"model\": \"o4-mini-2025-04-16\",\n  \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n  \"service_tier\": null,\n  \"system_fingerprint\": null,\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"completion_tokens\": 23305,\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 1179,\n    \"total_tokens\": 24484,\n    \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n      \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"reasoning_tokens\": 18240,\n      \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n    },\n    \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"cached_tokens\": 0\n    }\n  },\n  \"prompt_filter_results\": [\n    {\n      \"prompt_index\": 0,\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"jailbreak\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
