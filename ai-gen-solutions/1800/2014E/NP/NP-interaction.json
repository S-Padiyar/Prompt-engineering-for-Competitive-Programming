Rendez-vous de Marian et Robin\n\ntime limit per test5 seconds\n\nmemory limit per test256 megabytes\n\nIn the humble act of meeting, joy doth unfold like a flower in bloom.\n\nAbsence makes the heart grow fonder. Marian sold her last ware at the Market at the same time Robin finished training at the Major Oak. They couldn't wait to meet, so they both start without delay.\n\n\n\nThe travel network is represented as n\n\n vertices numbered from 1\n\n to n\n\n and m\n\n edges. The i\n\n-th edge connects vertices ui\n\n and vi\n\n, and takes wi\n\n seconds to travel (all wi\n\n are even). Marian starts at vertex 1\n\n (Market) and Robin starts at vertex n\n\n (Major Oak).\n\n\n\nIn addition, h\n\n of the n\n\n vertices each has a single horse available. Both Marian and Robin are capable riders, and could mount horses in no time (i.e. in 0\n\n seconds). Travel times are halved when riding. Once mounted, a horse lasts the remainder of the travel. Meeting must take place on a vertex (i.e. not on an edge). Either could choose to wait on any vertex.\n\n\n\nOutput the earliest time Robin and Marian can meet. If vertices 1\n\n and n\n\n are disconnected, output −1\n\n as the meeting is cancelled.\n\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer t\n\n (1≤t≤104\n\n) — the number of test cases.\n\n\n\nThe first line of each test case consists of three integers n\n\n, m\n\n, h\n\n (2≤n≤2⋅105,1≤m≤2⋅105,1≤h≤n\n\n) — the number of vertices, the number of edges and the number of vertices that have a single horse.\n\n\n\nThe second line of each test case contains h\n\n distinct integers a1,a2,…,ah\n\n (1≤ai≤n\n\n) — the vertices that have a single horse available.\n\n\n\nThen follow m\n\n lines of each test case, each with three integers ui\n\n, vi\n\n, wi\n\n (1≤ui,vi≤n,2≤wi≤106\n\n) — meaning that there is an edge between vertices ui\n\n and vi\n\n with travel cost wi\n\n seconds without a horse.\n\n\n\nThere are no self loops or multiple edges. By good fortune, all wi\n\n are even integers.\n\n\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sums of both n\n\n and m\n\n over all test cases do not exceed 2⋅105\n\n.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single integer, the earliest time Robin and Marian can meet.

Marian starts at vertex \\\\(1\\\\), Robin starts at vertex \\\\(n\\\\).  There are \\\\(h\\\\) special vertices each of which holds exactly one horse.  A traveler who reaches a horse‐vertex can instantly mount the horse (cost 0 time) and from that point on travels at half the speed (i.e.\\\\ every edge weight is halved). Once mounted, they cannot (and do not need to) dismount.\\n\\nWe want to find the earliest time \\\\(T\\\\) such that there is some vertex \\\\(v\\\\) where both Marian and Robin can arrive (in possibly different modes, on foot or on horse) by time \\\\(T\\\\).  They can wait at vertices, so arriving earlier never hurts.  If the graph is disconnected so that \\\\(1\\\\) and \\\\(n\\\\) lie in different components, the answer is \\\\(-1\\\\).\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Key observations / approach**\\n\\n1.  Each traveler has two “modes” at each vertex \\\\(u\\\\):\\n   - Mode 0 (“on foot”): has not yet picked up a horse.\\n   - Mode 1 (“on horse”): has already picked up a horse and from now on travels at half speed.\\n\\n2.  We build a directed graph on \\\\(2n\\\\) states:\\n\\n     For \\\\(u=0,1,\\\\dots,n-1\\\\) (using \\\\(0\\\\)-based internally):\\n     - State \\\\(u\\\\) represents \\\\((\\\\text{vertex }u, \\\\text{on foot})\\\\).\\n     - State \\\\(u + n\\\\) represents \\\\((\\\\text{vertex }u, \\\\text{on horse})\\\\).\\n\\n   - For every original undirected edge \\\\((u\\\\leftrightarrow v)\\\\) of weight \\\\(w\\\\):\\n     - Add edges\\n       ```\\n       (u on foot)   -> (v on foot)   with cost w\\n       (v on foot)   -> (u on foot)   with cost w\\n       (u on horse)  -> (v on horse)  with cost w/2\\n       (v on horse)  -> (u on horse)  with cost w/2\\n       ```\\n   - For every horse‐vertex \\\\(a\\\\), add a zero‐cost edge\\n       ```\\n       (a on foot) -> (a on horse)  with cost 0\\n       ```\\n     because you can mount your horse instantly at that vertex.\\n\\n3.  We then run **two** Dijkstra‐style shortest‐path computations on this \\\\(2n\\\\)‐state directed graph:\\n   - One from the source state \\\\(0\\\\) (Marian starts at vertex \\\\(1\\\\) = index \\\\(0\\\\) in 0‐based).\\n   - One from the source state \\\\(n-1\\\\) (Robin starts at vertex \\\\(n\\\\) = index \\\\(n-1\\\\)).\\n\\n   These yield two distance arrays\\n   \\\\[\\n     \\\\mathrm{distM}[\\\\,\\\\cdot\\\\,],\\\\;\\\\mathrm{distR}[\\\\,\\\\cdot\\\\,],\\n   \\\\]\\n   each of length \\\\(2n\\\\).\\n\\n4.  For each original vertex \\\\(u\\\\in\\\\{0,1,\\\\dots,n-1\\\\}\\\\), the time for Marian to get to \\\\(u\\\\) is\\n   \\\\[\\n     T_M(u) \\\\;=\\\\;\\\\min\\\\bigl(\\\\mathrm{distM}[u],\\\\,\\\\mathrm{distM}[u+n]\\\\bigr),\\n   \\\\]\\n   and similarly for Robin\\n   \\\\[\\n     T_R(u) \\\\;=\\\\;\\\\min\\\\bigl(\\\\mathrm{distR}[u],\\\\,\\\\mathrm{distR}[u+n]\\\\bigr).\\n   \\\\]\\n   They can meet at \\\\(u\\\\) by time \\n   \\\\(\\\\max\\\\{T_M(u),T_R(u)\\\\}\\\\), \\n   since they may have to wait for the slower of the two.\\n\\n5.  We take \\n   \\\\[\\n     T = \\\\min_{u=0\\\\ldots n-1}\\\\,\\\\max\\\\{T_M(u),T_R(u)\\\\}.\\n   \\\\]\\n   If \\\\(T\\\\) remains “infinite” for all \\\\(u\\\\), the answer is \\\\(-1\\\\).  Otherwise, we output \\\\(T\\\\).\\n\\nBecause \\\\(n,m\\\\le2\\\\times10^5\\\\) overall and each edge produces 4 arcs in our state‐graph (plus \\\\(h\\\\) zero‐cost arcs), the total number of arcs never exceeds about \\\\(4m+h\\\\le10^6\\\\).

Each run yields an array `dist[...]` of length \\\\(2n\\\\).\\n\\n3. **Meeting time**  \\n   For original vertex \\\\(u\\\\in[0..n-1]\\\\), Marian’s best arrival time is \\n   \\\\(\\\\min(\\\\mathrm{distM}[u],\\\\,\\\\mathrm{distM}[u+n])\\\\),\\n   and similarly for Robin.  They meet by \\n   \\\\(\\\\max(\\\\text{Marian time},\\\\text{Robin time})\\\\).  \\n   Taking the minimum over all \\\\(u\\\\) gives the final answer.\\n\\n4. **Complexities**  \\n   - Building the graph is \\\\(O(m + h)\\\\).  \\n   - Each Dijkstra on \\\\(2n\\\\) nodes, \\\\(\\\\approx4m+h\\\\) arcs, costs \\\\(O\\\\bigl((n+m)\\\\log(n+m)\\\\bigr)\\\\).  \\n   - Overall across all test cases (with \\\\(\\\\sum n,\\\\sum m\\\\le2\\\\cdot10^5\\\\)) fits well within 5 seconds in Java.\\n\\nIf no meeting is possible (all distances infinite), we print `-1`.\",\n        \"refusal\": null,\n        \"role\": \"assistant\",\n        \"annotations\": [],\n        \"audio\": null,\n        \"function_call\": null,\n        \"tool_calls\": null\n      },\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"protected_material_code\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": true,\n          \"citation\": {\n            \"URL\": \"https://github.com/PurushamGurung/HackerRankAssignment/tree/2d5293fdddb314b61a0626e7925910ed5b7f8deb/DijkstraAlgo.java\",\n            \"license\": \"NOASSERTION\"\n          }\n        },\n        \"protected_material_text\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"created\": 1753309569,\n  \"model\": \"o4-mini-2025-04-16\",\n  \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n  \"service_tier\": null,\n  \"system_fingerprint\": null,\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"completion_tokens\": 7623,\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 881,\n    \"total_tokens\": 8504,\n    \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n      \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"reasoning_tokens\": 4992,\n      \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n    },\n    \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"cached_tokens\": 0\n    }\n  },\n  \"prompt_filter_results\": [\n    {\n      \"prompt_index\": 0,\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"jailbreak\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
