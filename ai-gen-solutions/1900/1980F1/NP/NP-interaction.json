Field Division (easy version)\n\ntime limit per test3 seconds\n\nmemory limit per test256 megabytes\n\nThis is an easy version of the problem; it differs from the hard version only by the question. The easy version only needs you to print whether some values are non-zero or not. The hard version needs you to print the exact values.\n\n\n\nAlice and Bob are dividing the field. The field is a rectangle of size n×m\n\n (2≤n,m≤109\n\n), the rows are numbered from 1\n\n to n\n\n from top to bottom, and the columns are numbered from 1\n\n to m\n\n from left to right. The cell at the intersection of row r\n\n and column c\n\n is denoted as (r,c\n\n).\n\n\n\nBob has k\n\n (2≤k≤2⋅105\n\n) fountains, all of them are located in different cells of the field. Alice is responsible for dividing the field, but she must meet several conditions:\n\n\n\nTo divide the field, Alice will start her path in any free (without a fountain) cell on the left or top side of the field and will move, each time moving to the adjacent cell down or right. Her path will end on the right or bottom side of the field.\n\nAlice's path will divide the field into two parts — one part will belong to Alice (this part includes the cells of her path), the other part — to Bob.\n\nAlice will own the part that includes the cell (n,1\n\n).\n\nBob will own the part that includes the cell (1,m\n\n).\n\nAlice wants to divide the field in such a way as to get as many cells as possible.\n\n\n\nBob wants to keep ownership of all the fountains, but he can give one of them to Alice. First, output the integer α\n\n — the maximum possible size of Alice's plot, if Bob does not give her any fountain (i.e., all fountains will remain on Bob's plot). Then output k\n\n non-negative integers a1,a2,…,ak\n\n, where:\n\n\n\nai=0\n\n, if after Bob gives Alice the i\n\n-th fountain, the maximum possible size of Alice's plot does not increase (i.e., remains equal to α\n\n);\n\nai=1\n\n, if after Bob gives Alice the i\n\n-th fountain, the maximum possible size of Alice's plot increases (i.e., becomes greater than α\n\n).\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t\n\n (1≤t≤104\n\n) — the number of test cases.\n\n\n\nThe first line of each test case contains three integers n\n\n, m\n\n, and k\n\n (2≤n,m≤109\n\n, 2≤k≤2⋅105\n\n) — the field sizes and the number of fountains, respectively.\n\n\n\nThen follow k\n\n lines, each containing two numbers ri\n\n and ci\n\n (1≤ri≤n\n\n, 1≤ci≤m\n\n) — the coordinates of the cell with the i\n\n-th fountain. It is guaranteed that all cells are distinct and none of them is (n,1\n\n).\n\n\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of k\n\n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105\n\n.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, first output α\n\n — the maximum size of the plot that can belong to Alice if Bob does not give her any of the fountains. Then output k\n\n non-negative integers a1,a2,…,ak\n\n, where:\n\n\n\nai=0\n\n, if after Bob gives Alice the i\n\n-th fountain, the maximum possible size of Alice's plot does not increase compared to the case when all k\n\n fountains belong to Bob;\n\nai=1\n\n, if after Bob gives Alice the i\n\n-th fountain, the maximum possible size of Alice's plot increases compared to the case when all k\n\n fountains belong to Bob.\n\nIf you output any other positive number instead of 1\n\n that fits into a 64-bit signed integer type, it will also be recognized as 1\n\n. Thus, a solution to the hard version of this problem will also pass the tests for the easy version.\n\n\n\nExample\n\nInputCopy\n\n5\n\n2 2 3\n\n1 1\n\n1 2\n\n2 2\n\n5 5 4\n\n1 2\n\n2 2\n\n3 4\n\n4 3\n\n2 5 9\n\n1 2\n\n1 5\n\n1 1\n\n2 2\n\n2 4\n\n2 5\n\n1 4\n\n2 3\n\n1 3\n\n6 4 4\n\n6 2\n\n1 3\n\n1 4\n\n1 2\n\n3 4 5\n\n2 1\n\n3 2\n\n1 4\n\n1 3\n\n2 4\n\nOutputCopy\n\n1\n\n1 0 1 \n\n11\n\n0 1 0 1 \n\n1\n\n0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 \n\n6\n\n1 0 0 0 \n\n1\n\n1 1 0 0 0 \n\nNote\n\nBelow are the images for the second example:\n\n\n\nThe indices of the fountains are labeled in green.
