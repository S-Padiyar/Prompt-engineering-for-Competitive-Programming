    "content": "**Analysis**\n\nWe are given a string `s` of length up to 2·10⁵ (over all test‐cases ≤ 3·10⁵), consisting of lowercase letters, and we must count how many nonempty strings `t ≠ \"a\"` have the property that we can partition `s` into substrings each equal either to `t` or to the literal string `\"a\"`, and at least one substring equals `t`.\n\nA key observation is that the only way to cover the non‐`'a'` characters of `s` is by using copies of `t` (because the `\"a\"`‐block covers exactly one `'a'`).  We record the positions (and values) of all non‐`'a'` letters in `s`.  Equivalently, write\n\n```\n   s =  a^{c0}  U1  a^{c1}  U2  a^{c2}  …  Uk  a^{c_k}\n```\n\nwhere each `Ui` is a single non‐`'a'` character, and each `c_j` is a (possibly zero) run of consecutive `'a'`s.  Let k be the number of non‐`'a'` letters (the length of the `U` array).\n\n- If k=0, there are no non‐`'a'` letters.  Then `s` is all `'a'`, and any nonempty `t≠\"a\"` must consist of some number L≥2 of `'a'`s.  One checks by DP that *every* L∈[2..n] works, so the answer is n−1.\n\n- Otherwise k≥1.  We look for ways to cover those k non‐`'a'`s by *blocks* each containing exactly r of them (for some divisor r|k), with each block matching the *same* pattern of letters and the same runs of `'a'` *inside* it.  Since there are in total k non‐`'a'`s, we will have m=k/r such blocks.\n\n  1) **Periodicity check.**  Let U[0..k-1] be the non‐`'a'` letters, and c[0..k] the runs of `'a'` between/around them.  If we decide each block should contain exactly r of the U’s, then U must be r‐periodic (i.e. U[i]=U[i+r] for all 0≤i<k−r), and similarly the *internal* gaps c[1..k−1] must be r‐periodic (c[i]=c[i+r] for all 1≤i<k−r).  If that fails, we cannot split into equal‐pattern blocks of size r.\n\n  2) **Edge‐gaps.**  Even if the non‐`'a'` pattern is r‐periodic, we are free to choose how many leading `'a'`s (y0) appear before the first non‐`'a'` in each block and how many trailing `'a'`s (yE) after the last in each block.  \n     -  For block j (0≤j<m), its leading‐a count is c[j·r] (the run of `'a'` just before the first of that block’s r letters).  \n     -  For block j, its trailing‐a count is c[j·r+r] (the run just after its last letter).  \n     To have *one* consistent string `t`, the amount of leading‐a in `t` must be ≤ the minimum of all c[j·r] over j=0..m−1, and the trailing‐a in `t` must be ≤ the minimum of all c[j·r+r], j=0..m−1.  \n     Thus y0_max = min_{0≤j<m} c[j·r],  yE_max = min_{1≤j≤m} c[j·r].  \n     For each pair 0≤y0≤y0_max and 0≤yE≤yE_max, we get a distinct `t` of length\n       \\[\n          L \\;=\\; y0 \\;+\\;r\\text{ non‐`a`} +\\;\\sum_{\\!i=1}^{r-1}c[i]\\;+\\;yE,\n       \\]\n     and with the correct pattern of non‐`'a'`s and `'a'`‐runs inside.  All such `t` are valid and distinct.\n\nSumming over all divisors r of k which pass the periodicity test, we add up (y0_max+1)×(yE_max+1).  If k=0 we separately return n−1.\n\nThis runs in O(n) per test (plus checking up to O(√k) divisors and O(k/r) periodicity checks), comfortably within the 2s/256 MB limits for total length ≤ 3·10⁵.\n\n---\n\n```java\nimport java.io.*;\nimport java.util.*;\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\n        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));\n        PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(System.out);\n        int t = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine().trim());\n        while (t-- > 0) {\n            String s = br.readLine();\n            int n = s.length();\n            // Build U (non-'a' chars) and c (runs of 'a' between/around them).\n            List<Character> U = new ArrayList<>();\n            List<Integer> cList = new ArrayList<>();\n            int run = 0;\n            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                char ch = s.charAt(i);\n                if (ch == 'a') {\n                    run++;\n                } else {\n                    // we've ended a run of 'a', store it and reset\n                    cList.add(run);\n                    run = 0;\n                    U.add(ch);\n                }\n            }\n            // final run after last non-'a'\n            cList.add(run);\n\n            int k = U.size();  // number of non-'a' letters\n            if (k == 0) {\n                // all 'a': any t = \"a\"^L for L=2..n works\n                out.println(n - 1);\n                continue;\n            }\n\n            // Convert lists to arrays for speed\n            char[] up = new char[k];\n            for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) up[i] = U.get(i);\n            int[] c = new int[k + 1];\n            for (int i = 0; i <= k; i++) c[i] = cList.get(i);\n\n            // Find all divisors of k\n            List<Integer> divisors = new ArrayList<>();\n            for (int d = 1; d * d <= k; d++) {\n                if (k % d == 0) {\n                    divisors.add(d);\n                    if (d != k / d) divisors.add(k / d);\n                }\n            }\n\n            long ans = 0;\n            // For each block-size r that divides k\n            for (int r : divisors) {\n                int m = k / r;  // number of blocks\n\n                // 1) Check periodicity of the non-'a' letters\n                boolean ok = true;\n                // up must satisfy up[i] == up[i+r] for i=0..k-r-1\n                for (int i = 0; i + r < k; i++) {\n                    if (up[i] != up[i + r]) {\n                        ok = false;\n                        break;\n                    }\n                }\n                if (!ok) continue;\n\n                // 2) Check periodicity of the *internal* c-gaps c[1..k-1]\n                // we require c[i] == c[i+r] for i=1..k-r-1\n                for (int i = 1; i + r < k; i++) {\n                    if (c[i] != c[i + r]) {\n                        ok = false;\n                        break;\n                    }\n                }\n                if (!ok) continue;\n\n                // 3) Compute how many leading a's we can choose (y0_max)\n                int y0max = Integer.MAX_VALUE;\n                for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {\n                    int idx = j * r;  // c[idx] is the run before the block\n                    y0max = Math.min(y0max, c[idx]);\n                }\n                // 4) Compute trailing a's (yEm) we can choose\n                int yEmax = Integer.MAX_VALUE;\n                for (int j = 1; j <= m; j++) {\n                    int idx = j * r;  // c[idx] is the run after the block\n                    yEmax = Math.min(yEmax, c[idx]);\n                }\n\n                // All pairs y0 in [0..y0max], yE in [0..yEmax] yield valid t\n                ans += (long)(y0max + 1) * (yEmax + 1);\n            }\n\n            out.println(ans);\n        }\n        out.flush();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation of the Main Steps**\n\n1.  We scan the string `s` and record in `U` each non‐`'a'` character in order.  Simultaneously we build a list `cList` of the lengths of runs of `'a'`:\n    -  Whenever we see a `'a'`, we increment a counter `run`.\n    -  When we hit a non‐`'a'`, we append that `run` to `cList` (that is the run *before* that non‐`'a'`), reset `run` to 0, and store the non‐`'a'` in `U`.\n    -  After the loop, we append the final run of `'a'`s.\n\n    Thus after this we have\n      ```\n      s = a^{c[0]} U[0] a^{c[1]} U[1] … U[k-1] a^{c[k]},\n      ```\n    where `k = U.size()` is the number of non‐`'a'`s.\n\n2.  If `k==0` (no non‐`'a'` at all), `s` is all `'a'`.  The only non‐empty `t≠\"a\"` must be pure `'a'` of length ≥2, and one checks that *every* length L from 2..n works.  So the answer is `n−1`.\n\n3.  Otherwise we have k≥1.  Let us pick **r** a positive divisor of k.  We try to tile the k non‐`'a'` characters by `m = k/r` identical blocks, each containing exactly r of them.  Such a tiling is possible *only* if\n   -  the sequence `U[0..k−1]` of non‐`'a'`s is *r-periodic*, i.e.\n        U[i] == U[i+r]  for all 0 ≤ i < k−r;\n   -  the **internal** runs of `'a'` between those non‐`'a'`s are also r-periodic, i.e.\n        c[i] == c[i+r]  for all 1 ≤ i < k−r.\n\n   If either fails, that r cannot work.\n\n4.  If it passes, we compute how many `'a'`s we can put *before* each block and *after* each block consistently.  \n   -  Block j (0-based) covers U[jr],U[jr+1],…U[jr+r−1], so its leading run of `'a'` is `c[jr]`.  We must pick a uniform number `0 ≤ y0 ≤ min_{j} c[jr]`.  \n   -  Its trailing run is `c[jr+r]`, and we pick `0 ≤ yE ≤ min_{j} c[jr+r]`.  \n\n   Any pair `(y0,yE)` yields one distinct string  \n      t = a^{y0} U[0] a^{c[1]} U[1] … a^{c[r−1]} U[r−1] a^{yE}  \n   of length `L=y0 + (r non-a) + sum_{i=1..r-1} c[i] + yE`, and since U/c are periodic, each of the `m` blocks in `s` matches exactly that same `t`.  In between those blocks we have only `'a'`s, which we cover by single-character `\"a\"` substrings.  \n\n5.  Therefore for this divisor r we get `(y0_max+1)*(yE_max+1)` valid `t`’s.  We sum over all divisors.  That runs in O(k/r) per divisor, total O(∑_{r|k} k/r) = O(k·d(k)), and over all testcases ∑k ≤ 3·10⁵ is quite comfortable.\n\nThis solves the problem in O(n) per testcase (plus a small factor for divisor‐enumeration), well under the limits."
