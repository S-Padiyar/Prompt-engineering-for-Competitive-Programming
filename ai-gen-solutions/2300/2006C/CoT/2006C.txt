C. Eri and Expanded Sets

memory limit per test512 megabytes
Let there be a set that contains distinct positive integers. To expand the set to contain as many integers as possible, Eri can choose two integers x≠y
 from the set such that their average x+y2
 is still a positive integer and isn't contained in the set, and add it to the set. The integers x
 and y
 remain in the set.

Let's call the set of integers consecutive if, after the elements are sorted, the difference between any pair of adjacent elements is 1
. For example, sets {2}
, {2,5,4,3}
, {5,6,8,7}
 are consecutive, while {2,4,5,6}
, {9,7}
 are not.

Eri likes consecutive sets. Suppose there is an array b
, then Eri puts all elements in b
 into the set. If after a finite number of operations described above, the set can become consecutive, the array b
 will be called brilliant.

Note that if the same integer appears in the array multiple times, we only put it into the set once, as a set always contains distinct positive integers.

Eri has an array a
 of n
 positive integers. Please help him to count the number of pairs of integers (l,r)
 such that 1≤l≤r≤n
 and the subarray al,al+1,…,ar
 is brilliant.

Input
Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t
 (1≤t≤104
) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n
 (1≤n≤4⋅105
) — length of the array a
.

The second line of each test case contains n
 integers a1,a2,…an
 (1≤ai≤109
) — the elements of the array a
.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n
 over all test cases doesn't exceed 4⋅105
.

Output
For each test case, output a single integer — the number of brilliant subarrays.

Note
In the first test case, the array a=[2,2]
 has 3
 subarrays: [2]
, [2]
, and [2,2]
. For all of them, the set only contains a single integer 2
, therefore it's always consecutive. All these subarrays are brilliant, so the answer is 3
.

In the second test case, let's consider the subarray [3,6,10]
. We can do operations as follows:

{3,6,10}−→−−−−x=6,y=10{3,6,8,10}−→−−−−x=6,y=8{3,6,7,8,10}−→−−−−x=3,y=7{3,5,6,7,8,10}
−→−−−−x=3,y=5{3,4,5,6,7,8,10}−→−−−−x=8,y=10{3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}
{3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}
 is a consecutive set, so the subarray [3,6,10]
 is brilliant.
