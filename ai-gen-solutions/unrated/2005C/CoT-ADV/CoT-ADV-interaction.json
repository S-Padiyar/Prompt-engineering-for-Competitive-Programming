Lazy Narek\n\ntime limit per test2 seconds\n\nmemory limit per test256 megabytes\n\nNarek is too lazy to create the third problem of this contest. His friend Artur suggests that he should use ChatGPT. ChatGPT creates n\n\n problems, each consisting of m\n\n letters, so Narek has n\n\n strings. To make the problem harder, he combines the problems by selecting some of the n\n\n strings possibly none and concatenating them without altering their order. His chance of solving the problem is defined as scoren−scorec\n\n, where scoren\n\n is Narek's score and scorec\n\n is ChatGPT's score.\n\n\n\nNarek calculates scoren\n\n by examining the selected string (he moves from left to right). He initially searches for the letter \"n\"\n\n, followed by \"a\"\n\n, \"r\"\n\n, \"e\"\n\n, and \"k\"\n\n. Upon finding all occurrences of these letters, he increments scoren\n\n by 5\n\n and resumes searching for \"n\"\n\n again (he doesn't go back, and he just continues from where he left off).\n\n\n\nAfter Narek finishes, ChatGPT scans through the array and increments scorec\n\n by 1\n\n for each letter \"n\"\n\n, \"a\"\n\n, \"r\"\n\n, \"e\"\n\n, or \"k\"\n\n that Narek fails to utilize (note that if Narek fails to complete the last occurrence by finding all of the 5\n\n letters, then all of the letters he used are counted in ChatGPT's score scorec\n\n, and Narek doesn't get any points if he doesn't finish finding all the 5 letters).\n\n\n\nNarek aims to maximize the value of scoren−scorec\n\n by selecting the most optimal subset of the initial strings.\n\n\n\nInput\n\nIn the first line of the input, you're given a single integer t\n\n (1≤t≤105\n\n), the number of test cases. Then the description of each test case follows.\n\n\n\nIn the first line of each test case, you're given two integers n,m\n\n (1≤n,m≤103\n\n), the number of strings and the length of each string.\n\n\n\nIn the next n\n\n lines, you're given n\n\n strings, each having a length of m\n\n. The strings only contain lowercase letters of the English alphabet.\n\n\n\nThe sum of values of n⋅m\n\n over all test cases does not exceed 106\n\n.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single integer: the maximal possible value of scoren−scorec\n\n.\n\n\n\nExample\n\nInputCopy\n\n4\n\n5 2\n\nnn\n\naa\n\nrr\n\nee\n\nkk\n\n1 5\n\nnarek\n\n1 4\n\nnare\n\n5 7\n\nnrrarek\n\nnrnekan\n\nuuuuuuu\n\nppppppp\n\nnkarekz\n\nOutputCopy\n\n0\n\n5\n\n0\n\n7\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, one of the optimal answers is when Narek doesn't choose any of the strings, so the answer is 0\n\n. He can alternatively choose all the strings. In this case, the full string becomes \"nnaarreekk\". Narek can choose the first appearances of all letters and add 5\n\n to the score. His opponent will add 1\n\n for all second appearances, which will be 5\n\n in total. So the answer will be 5−5=0\n\n.\n\n\n\nIn the third test case, the only optimal answer is when Narek doesn't choose the string. Note that if he were to choose the string, he wouldn't be able to find the last letter \"k\", so his score would stay at 0\n\n instead of becoming 5\n\n. Then ChatGPT would add 4\n\n for all of the 4\n\n letters, and the answer would become 0−4=−4\n\n.\n\n\n\nIn the last test case, Narek needs to choose the first and the last strings. After putting these two next to each other, he gets \"nrrareknkarekz\n\n\". Narek can choose the letters marked with red and add 10\n\n to his score. Since the black colored letters Narek left behind are eligible for the opponent to claim (they are used in the word \"narek\"), the opponent adds all other letters to the score and gets a score of 3\n\n. Therefore, the answer is 10−3=7\n\n.\n\n---\n\nYou are a competitive programming assistant solving Codeforces problems using Java. First, carefully read and restate the problem in your own words to ensure full understanding. Identify the input and output formats, list the constraints, and consider any edge cases that might affect the logic. Next, determine which algorithmic pattern the problem fits best—such as greedy, binary search, two pointers, dynamic programming, or graph traversal—and briefly explain why that pattern applies. Then, plan your solution step by step, describing the key ideas, data structures, or mathematical insights you’ll use. Once your plan is clear, write a clean and fully working Java program. Use import java.util.*; and include a Main class with a main method, using Scanner or BufferedReader for input depending on the constraints. Add comments to explain important logic in the code. After coding, walk through a sample input manually to show how your solution works in practice. Finally, analyze the time and space complexity of your approach using Big-O notation, justifying your answer. Think step by step and only write code once the logic is sound and complete."

We keep a DP state\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\mathrm{dp}[k] = \\\\max\\\\bigl(10x - t\\\\bigr)\\n\\\\]\\nfor having matched \\\\(k\\\\) letters of the current (incomplete) “narek” pattern (so \\\\(k=0\\\\) means we’re looking next for 'n', \\\\(k=1\\\\) means we've just matched 'n' and look next for 'a', …, up to \\\\(k=4\\\\) looking for final 'k').\\n\\nTransitioning over a block \\\\(s\\\\):\\n\\n1.

Taking this block from state \\\\(k_{\\\\mathrm{in}}\\\\) yields  \\n   \\\\[\\n     \\\\Delta(\\\\mathrm{dp}) = 10\\\\cdot x_{\\\\mathrm{add}} - t_{\\\\mathrm{add}},\\n     \\\\quad\\n     k_{\\\\mathrm{out}}.\\n   \\\\]\\n4. We do the usual “take or skip” DP update, keeping the best over both.\\n\\nSince each block is at most length \\\\(m\\\\), and we have 5 states, each block costs \\\\(O(5m)\\\\) to precompute its transitions.  The DP over \\\\(n\\\\) blocks is \\\\(O(n\\\\cdot5)\\\\).

Hitting `k==5` means one full “narek” is found (so we'll add \\\\(+10\\\\) to our net score, since \\\\(10x\\\\) appears in the formula).  Then reset `k=0` and continue scanning.\\n   - That gives us two integers for each `k_in`:  \\n     - `xAdd[k_in]` = how many full patterns we formed inside this block,  \\n     - `outState[k_in]` = the final automaton state (how many letters of the next pattern are already matched).\\n   - Taking the block moves `dp[k_in] → dp'[outState[k_in]]` with an increment of `10*xAdd[k_in] - t_add`.\\n\\n3. **\\\"Take or Skip\\\"**  \\n   We do both in one sweep by starting `newDp = dp` (the “skip” case) and then attempting the “take” transitions, taking the maximum.\\n\\n4. **Final Answer**  \\n   After processing all blocks, the best net score is \\\\(\\\\max_{k} dp[k]\\\\).  We also compare with 0, since we can always choose no strings.\\n\\n**Complexity Analysis**\\n\\n- Preprocessing each block of length \\\\(m\\\\) costs \\\\(O(m)\\\\) to count pattern letters, and \\\\(O(5m)\\\\) to simulate the 5 entry states → \\\\(O(5m)\\\\).\\n- There are \\\\(n\\\\) blocks, and \\\\(\\\\sum n m \\\\le 10^6\\\\), so total work \\\\(\\\\displaystyle O\\\\bigl(\\\\sum 5m\\\\bigr)=O(5\\\\cdot10^6)\\\\) over all tests.  \\n- The DP over \\\\(n\\\\) blocks is another \\\\(O(5n)\\\\), which is negligible in comparison.\\n- Overall time is \\\\(O(\\\\sum n m)\\\\), comfortably within the limits.\\n\\nThis solves the problem in under 2 seconds and within the 256 MB memory limit.\",\n        \"refusal\": null,\n        \"role\": \"assistant\",\n        \"annotations\": [],\n        \"audio\": null,\n        \"function_call\": null,\n        \"tool_calls\": null\n      },\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"protected_material_code\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"protected_material_text\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"created\": 1753326295,\n  \"model\": \"o4-mini-2025-04-16\",\n  \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n  \"service_tier\": null,\n  \"system_fingerprint\": null,\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"completion_tokens\": 6218,\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 1121,\n    \"total_tokens\": 7339,\n    \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n      \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"reasoning_tokens\": 4032,\n      \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n    },\n    \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"cached_tokens\": 0\n    }\n  },\n  \"prompt_filter_results\": [\n    {\n      \"prompt_index\": 0,\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"jailbreak\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
