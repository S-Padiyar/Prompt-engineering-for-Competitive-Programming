First, carefully read and restate the problem in your own words to ensure full understanding. Identify the input and output formats, list the constraints, and consider any edge cases that might affect the logic. Next, determine which algorithmic pattern the problem fits best—such as greedy, binary search, two pointers, dynamic programming, or graph traversal—and briefly explain why that pattern applies. Then, plan your solution step by step, describing the key ideas, data structures, or mathematical insights you’ll use. Once your plan is clear, write a clean and fully working Java program. Use import java.util.*; and include a Main class with a main method, using Scanner or BufferedReader for input depending on the constraints. Add comments to explain important logic in the code. After coding, walk through a sample input manually to show how your solution works in practice. Finally, analyze the time and space complexity of your approach using Big-O notation, justifying your answer. Think step by step and only write code once the logic is sound and complete."

Each \\\\(a_i\\\\) and \\\\(k\\\\) can be up to \\\\(10^9\\\\).\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Key Observations**\\n\\n1. **When \\\\(n=1\\\\)**, no operation is possible (we need two distinct indices).  The array stays as \\\\(\\\\{a_1\\\\}\\\\).  Its missing nonnegatives are all \\\\(x\\\\ne a_1\\\\).  \\n   - If \\\\(a_1>0\\\\), then the first \\\\(a_1\\\\) missing integers are \\\\(0,1,\\\\dots,a_1-1\\\\).  \\n     - If \\\\(k\\\\le a_1\\\\), then \\\\(\\\\text{mex}_k=k-1\\\\).  \\n     - If \\\\(k>a_1\\\\), then the missing list continues from \\\\(a_1+0,a_1+1,\\\\dots\\\\), so \\\\(\\\\text{mex}_k = a_1 + (k - a_1)\\\\).  \\n   - If \\\\(a_1=0\\\\), the missing are \\\\(1,2,3,\\\\dots\\\\), so \\\\(\\\\text{mex}_k=k\\\\).\\n\\n2. **When \\\\(n\\\\ge2\\\\)**, a well‐known fact about “subtract and add” operations is that you can reduce the array's values (and mix them) until all entries become arbitrary nonnegative multiples of the *gcd* \\\\(g\\\\) of the original array.  Moreover, you can choose up to \\\\(n\\\\) **distinct** multiples of \\\\(g\\\\) (making duplicates only wastes spots for covering missing values).  \\n\\n   Thus, optimally, you pick\\n   \\\\[\\n     S = \\\\{0\\\\cdot g,\\\\;1\\\\cdot g,\\\\;2\\\\cdot g,\\\\;\\\\dots,\\\\;(t-1)\\\\cdot g\\\\},\\n   \\\\]\\n   with \\\\(t\\\\le n\\\\), so that these \\\\(t\\\\) distinct multiples are present.  Everything else in \\\\(\\\\{0,1,2,\\\\dots\\\\}\\\\) is *missing*.  \\n\\n   - There are \\\\(g-1\\\\) missing integers *between* each consecutive pair of multiples \\\\(m\\\\cdot g\\\\) and \\\\((m+1)\\\\cdot g\\\\).  \\n   - After \\\\((t-1)\\\\cdot g\\\\), **all** integers \\\\(\\\\ge t\\\\cdot g\\\\) are missing.\\n\\n   Let\\n     \\\\[\\n       \\\\Delta = g-1,\\\\quad M = t\\\\cdot\\\\Delta = t\\\\,(g-1).\\n     \\\\]\\n   These are:\\n   - \\\\(\\\\Delta\\\\) = how many are missing per gap,\\n   - \\\\(M\\\\) = how many are missing before reaching \\\\(t\\\\cdot g\\\\).\\n\\n   We have two cases:\\n\\n   **Case A** \\\\(\\\\;M \\\\ge k\\\\).  \\n     Then the \\\\(k\\\\)-th missing lies among the first \\\\(t\\\\) blocks.  Numbering the missing globally from 1, each block of size \\\\(\\\\Delta\\\\) contributes \\\\(\\\\Delta\\\\) missing integers.  \\n       - Let \\\\(b = \\\\lfloor (k-1)/\\\\Delta\\\\rfloor\\\\) be the zero‐based block index.\\n       - Let \\\\(\\\\text{off} = (k-1)\\\\bmod \\\\Delta\\\\).  Then inside block \\\\(b\\\\), the missing numbers run from \\n         \\\\[\\n           b\\\\cdot g + 1,\\\\;b\\\\cdot g + 2,\\\\;\\\\dots,\\\\;b\\\\cdot g + \\\\Delta.\\n         \\\\]\\n       - So\\n         \\\\[\\n           \\\\text{mex}_k\\n           = b\\\\cdot g + 1 + \\\\text{off}.\\n         \\\\]\\n     Note this formula only makes sense if \\\\(\\\\Delta>0\\\\), i.e.\\\\ \\\\(g>1\\\\).\\n\\n   **Case B** \\\\(\\\\;M < k\\\\).  \\n     Then we exhaust the first \\\\(t\\\\) blocks but still need \\\\((k-M)\\\\) more.  After that, *every* integer starting from \\\\(t\\\\cdot g\\\\) is missing, so they are consecutive.  Hence\\n     \\\\[\\n       \\\\text{mex}_k\\n       = t\\\\cdot g \\\\;+\\\\;\\\\bigl((k-M)-1\\\\bigr)\\n       = t\\\\cdot g\\\\;+\\\\;(k - t\\\\,(g-1)\\\\;-\\\\;1).\\n     \\\\]\\n   Since in Case B the expression is strictly increasing in \\\\(t\\\\), we choose the maximum \\\\(t=n\\\\).  \\n\\n   Putting it all together, for \\\\(n\\\\ge2\\\\):\\n   - Compute \\\\(g=\\\\gcd(a_1,\\\\dots,a_n)\\\\).\\n   - If \\\\(g=1\\\\), then \\\\(\\\\Delta=0\\\\) so Case A is impossible, and in fact all small nonnegatives can be covered consecutively up to \\\\(n-1\\\\).  You end up with the present set \\\\(\\\\{0,1,2,\\\\dots,n-1\\\\}\\\\) so the missing start at \\\\(n,n+1,\\\\dots\\\\).
