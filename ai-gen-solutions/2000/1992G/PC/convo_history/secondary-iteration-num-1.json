    "content": "**Analysis**\n\nWe have an array `a` of length `n` consisting of the numbers 1,2,…,n (i.e. a permutation of 1…n).  We must sum, over *all* subsets `S` of {1,…,n}, the quantity\n\n  **MEX**(S,|S|+1)\n\nwhere “MEX(S,k)” means “the k-th positive integer (strictly > 0) that is *not* in the set S.”\n\nSince the input array is just a permutation of 1…n, all that matters is *which* subsets of {1,…,n} we take, not the order.  So define\n\n  S(n) =  Σ_{S ⊆ {1…n}}  MEX( S, |S|+1 ).\n\nWe wish to compute S(n) modulo 1 000 000 007 for various n up to 5000, with the sum of n² over all test‐cases ≤ 2.5·10⁷.\n\n---\n\n**Key combinatorial insight**\n\nLet a subset `S` have size $m = |S|`.  Then among {1,…,n} exactly `r = n−m` elements are *missing* from `S`.  Beyond n, all integers `n+1, n+2, …` are also “missing.”  When we ask for the (m+1)-th missing positive integer:\n\n- If `r ≥ m+1` — i.e. there are at least m+1 missing numbers *inside* {1…n} — then the answer is the (m+1)-th smallest element in `{1…n} \\ S`.\n- If `r < m+1`, i.e. `n−m < m+1` ⇔ `2m+1 > n`, then the first `r` missing integers are in 1…n, and we must go out to the integers > n to pick the (m+1)-th.  A short check shows it becomes `n + ( (m+1) − r ) = 2m+1`.\n\nThus the contribution of *all* subsets of size m splits into two regimes:\n\n1. **Small m** (so that `2m+1 ≤ n`).  In this case each subset of size m` has a varying MEX equal to the (m+1)-th missing between 1…n.  One can show by standard “k-th one/zero” arguments on a 0–1 string of length n (where 1 = “missing,” 0 = “in S”) that the *sum* of these MEX‐values over all `C(n,m)` choices of S is\n     \n     Σ_{x=m+1 to 2m+1}  x · C(x−1, m) · C(n−x, (n−m)−(m+1))\n     \n   which simplifies to\n     \n     Σ_{x=m+1..2m+1}  x·C(x−1,m)·C(n−x, n−2m−1).\n\n2. **Large m** (so that `2m+1 > n`).  Then *every* subset of size m has `MEX = 2m+1`.  There are `C(n,m)` such subsets, so they contribute\n\n     (2m+1) · C(n,m).\n\nHence\n\n  S(n)\n  =  Σ_{m=0..⌊(n−1)/2⌋}   Σ_{x=m+1..2m+1}  x·C(x−1,m)·C(n−x,n−2m−1)\n   + Σ_{m=⌈n/2⌉..n}        (2m+1)·C(n,m).\n\nWe can compute this in O(n²) per test by precomputing factorials+inverse factorials up to n for binomial-coefficients in O(1).  Since the problem guarantees that the *sum* of n² over all testcases ≤ 2.5·10⁷, the total work of O(∑n²) ≤ 2.5·10⁷ is perfectly fine in Java with fast I/O.\n\n---\n\n**Implementation in Java**\n\n```java\nimport java.io.*;\nimport java.util.*;\n\npublic class Main {\n    static final int MOD = 1_000_000_007;\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\n        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));\n        int t = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine().trim());\n        int[] ns = new int[t];\n        int maxn = 0;\n        for (int i = 0; i < t; i++) {\n            ns[i] = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine().trim());\n            if (ns[i] > maxn) maxn = ns[i];\n        }\n\n        // Precompute factorials and inverse factorials up to maxn\n        int N = maxn;\n        int[] fac = new int[N+1];\n        int[] ifac = new int[N+1];\n        fac[0] = 1;\n        for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {\n            fac[i] = (int)((long)fac[i-1] * i % MOD);\n        }\n        ifac[N] = modPow(fac[N], MOD-2);\n        for (int i = N; i > 0; i--) {\n            ifac[i-1] = (int)((long)ifac[i] * i % MOD);\n        }\n\n        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\n        // Process each test case\n        for (int n : ns) {\n            long ans = 0;\n\n            // Case 1: m <= floor((n-1)/2), use the double sum\n            int half = (n - 1) / 2;\n            for (int m = 0; m <= half; m++) {\n                int r = n - 2*m - 1;  // how many ones remain after the (m+1)-th\n                long sumM = 0;\n                // x runs from m+1 to 2m+1\n                int L = m + 1, R = 2*m + 1;\n                for (int x = L; x <= R; x++) {\n                    // term = x * C(x-1, m) * C(n-x, r)\n                    long t1 = fac[x-1];\n                    t1 = t1 * ifac[m] % MOD;\n                    t1 = t1 * ifac[(x-1)-m] % MOD;\n                    long t2 = fac[n-x];\n                    t2 = t2 * ifac[r] % MOD;\n                    t2 = t2 * ifac[(n-x)-r] % MOD;\n                    long term = ( (long)x * t1 % MOD ) * t2 % MOD;\n                    sumM = (sumM + term) % MOD;\n                }\n                ans = (ans + sumM) % MOD;\n            }\n\n            // Case 2: m >= ceil(n/2), MEX = 2m+1 always\n            int start = (n + 1) / 2; // ceil(n/2)\n            for (int m = start; m <= n; m++) {\n                // (2m+1)*C(n,m)\n                long comb = (long)fac[n] * ifac[m] % MOD * ifac[n-m] % MOD;\n                long term = comb * (2L*m + 1) % MOD;\n                ans = (ans + term) % MOD;\n            }\n\n            sb.append(ans).append('\\n');\n        }\n\n        System.out.print(sb.toString());\n    }\n\n    // Fast exponentiation mod\n    static int modPow(long a, int p) {\n        long res = 1, x = a % MOD;\n        while (p > 0) {\n            if ((p & 1) != 0) res = (res * x) % MOD;\n            x = (x * x) % MOD;\n            p >>= 1;\n        }\n        return (int)res;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation of Main Steps**\n\n1. **Reading input,** storing all `n`, tracking the maximum `n` needed.\n2. **Precompute** factorials `fac[i] = i! mod` and inverse factorials `ifac[i] = (i!)^{-1} mod` up to `n = maxn` in O(maxn) time.\n3.

Every subset of size `m` has\n      MEX = `2m+1`.  There are `C(n,m)` of them, contributing\n      `(2m+1)·C(n,m)`.\n\n4.
