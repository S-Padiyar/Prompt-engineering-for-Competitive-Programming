First, carefully read and restate the problem in your own words to ensure full understanding. Identify the input and output formats, list the constraints, and consider any edge cases that might affect the logic. Next, determine which algorithmic pattern the problem fits best—such as greedy, binary search, two pointers, dynamic programming, or graph traversal—and briefly explain why that pattern applies. Then, plan your solution step by step, describing the key ideas, data structures, or mathematical insights you’ll use. Once your plan is clear, write a clean and fully working Java program. Use import java.util.*; and include a Main class with a main method, using Scanner or BufferedReader for input depending on the constraints. Add comments to explain important logic in the code. After coding, walk through a sample input manually to show how your solution works in practice. Finally, analyze the time and space complexity of your approach using Big-O notation, justifying your answer. Think step by step and only write code once the logic is sound and complete."

We want to turn *every* cell white using two kinds of operations, each costing 1:\\n\\n1. **2×2 subgrid-whitening**: Choose any consecutive rows \\\\(i,i+1\\\\) and columns \\\\(j,j+1\\\\); paint those 4 cells white.\\n2. **Whole-row whitening**: Choose any row \\\\(i\\\\) and paint *all* \\\\(n\\\\) cells of that row white.\\n\\nWe need the minimum total number of these operations to make the entire grid white.\\n\\n**Key Observations and Reduction**\\n\\n1. **Rows with \\\\(a_i\\\\ge5\\\\) are always cheaper to clear by the single‐row operation.**  \\n   A 2×2 op clears at most 2 black cells in that row (it covers two rows). To clear \\\\(\\\\ge5\\\\) black cells by only 2×2 blocks (using blocks both above and below) would cost \\\\(\\\\ge3\\\\) such blocks, i.e.\\\\ \\\\(\\\\ge3\\\\) operations, whereas a single‐row operation costs only 1.  \\n   Hence every row \\\\(i\\\\) with \\\\(a_i\\\\ge5\\\\) we *must* pay 1 for a whole-row op; blocks on its edges would only increase cost.\\n\\n2. **All other \\\\(a_i\\\\le4\\\\) form independent “segments” in the row-index.**  \\n   We split the rows into maximal contiguous runs where \\\\(a_i\\\\le4\\\\). Across each boundary where \\\\(a_i\\\\ge5\\\\), we forcibly pay +1 and cannot place any 2×2 blocks that cross that boundary. Thus the problem reduces to solving each segment of rows with \\\\(0\\\\le a_i\\\\le4\\\\), plus a simple count of how many rows \\\\(a_i\\\\ge5\\\\).\\n\\n3. **Within a segment, we use a small DP.**  \\n   - Each row \\\\(i\\\\) in the segment has between 0 and 4 black cells; define  \\n     \\\\[\\n       b_i \\\\;=\\\\;\\\\Bigl\\\\lceil \\\\frac{a_i}{2}\\\\Bigr\\\\rceil\\n       \\\\quad(\\\\text{the number of “pairs” of black cells it has}).\\n     \\\\]  \\n   - A 2×2 block placed between rows \\\\(i\\\\) and \\\\(i+1\\\\) reduces each of those two rows by 2 black cells; think of it as “giving 1 unit” of coverage toward both row \\\\(i\\\\) and row \\\\(i+1\\\\).  \\n   - We can place at most one such block between rows \\\\(i\\\\) and \\\\(i+1\\\\) *if and only if* both \\\\(a_i\\\\ge2\\\\) and \\\\(a_{i+1}\\\\ge2\\\\).  (Since \\\\(a_i\\\\le4\\\\), we never need more than 1 block there.)\\n   - If for row \\\\(i\\\\) the total coverage from the block above \\\\((c_{i-1})\\\\) plus the block below \\\\((c_i)\\\\) is \\\\(\\\\ge b_i\\\\), then row \\\\(i\\\\) is fully cleared by those blocks and needs *no* whole‐row op; otherwise we pay +1 to do the whole‐row op.\\n\\n   Thus in each segment we do a linear DP over rows \\\\(i\\\\), carrying in a state \\\\(prev\\\\in\\\\{0,1\\\\}\\\\) = “did we place a block between \\\\(i-1\\\\) and \\\\(i\\\\)?”.  At step \\\\(i\\\\) we decide whether to place the block \\\\((c_i=0\\\\text{ or }1)\\\\) between \\\\(i\\\\) and \\\\(i+1\\\\) (if allowed), pay cost \\\\(c_i\\\\), and possibly pay +1 if \\\\((prev+c_i)<b_i\\\\).  We pass `prev = c_i` to the next row.  At the segment ends we force the “outside” block‐placement to be 0.  This DP runs in \\\\(O(\\\\text{segment length}\\\\times2\\\\times2)\\\\).\\n\\nSumming over all segments and adding the count of rows with \\\\(a_i\\\\ge5\\\\) gives the global optimum in \\\\(O(n)\\\\) per test.\\n\\n---\\n\\n```java\\nimport java.io.*;\\nimport java.util.*;\\n\\npublic class Main {\\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\\n        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));\\n        int t = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine().trim());\\n        StringBuilder output = new StringBuilder();\\n        while (t-- > 0) {\\n            int n = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine().trim());\\n            int[] a = new int[n];\\n            StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine(), \\\" \\\");\\n            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\\n                a[i] = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\\n            }\\n\\n            int answer = 0;\\n            // First, any row with a[i] >= 5 must be row‐dyed at cost 1, and\\n            // it breaks any block‐placement across that boundary.\\n            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\\n                if (a[i] >= 5) {\\n                    answer++;\\n                }\\n            }\\n\\n            // Process each maximal contiguous segment where 0 <= a[i] <= 4 by DP\\n            int i = 0;\\n            while (i < n) {\\n                // skip pre‐dyed rows\\n                if (a[i] >= 5) {\\n                    i++;\\n                    continue;\\n                }\\n                // segment start\\n                int start = i;\\n                while (i < n && a[i] <= 4) {\\n                    i++;\\n                }\\n                int end = i - 1;  // [start..end] all have a[i]<=4\\n\\n                // Precompute b[i] = ceil(a[i]/2), and eligibility of blocks between i and i+1\\n                int len = end - start + 1;\\n                int[] b = new int[len];\\n                boolean[] canBlockNext = new boolean[len]; \\n                for (int j = 0; j < len; j++) {\\n                    b[j] = (a[start + j] + 1) >> 1;  // ceil(a/2)\\n                }\\n                for (int j = 0; j + 1 < len; j++) {\\n                    // we can place one 2×2 block between row (start+j) and (start+j+1)\\n                    canBlockNext[j] = (a[start + j] >= 2 && a[start + j + 1] >= 2);\\n                }\\n                canBlockNext[len - 1] = false;  // no block beyond segment end\\n\\n                // dpPrev[c] = min cost up to row j-1 with prev = c (0 or 1)\\n                final int INF = 1_000_000_000;\\n                int[] dpPrev = new int[2], dpCur = new int[2];\\n                dpPrev[0] = 0;      // before the first row, we placed no block\\n                dpPrev[1] = INF;    // impossible\\n\\n                // Walk through the rows in this segment\\n                for (int j = 0; j < len; j++) {\\n                    dpCur[0] = dpCur[1] = INF;\\n                    for (int prev = 0; prev <= 1; prev++) {\\n                        if (dpPrev[prev] >= INF) continue;\\n                        // choose c = 0 or 1 if allowed\\n                        for (int c = 0; c <= 1; c++) {\\n                            if (c == 1 && !canBlockNext[j]) continue;\\n                            // row‐dye needed if (prev + c) < b[j]\\n                            int needRowDye = (prev + c < b[j]) ? 1 : 0;\\n                            int cost = dpPrev[prev] + c + needRowDye;\\n                            if (cost < dpCur[c]) {\\n                                dpCur[c] = cost;\\n                            }\\n                        }\\n                    }\\n                    // shift\\n                    dpPrev[0] = dpCur[0];\\n                    dpPrev[1] = dpCur[1];\\n                }\\n                // at segment end we must have placed c=0 beyond it\\n                answer += dpPrev[0];\\n            }\\n\\n            output.append(answer).append('\\\\n');\\n        }\\n\\n        System.out.print(output);\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Explanation of Key Steps**\\n\\n1. **Rows with \\\\(a_i \\\\ge 5\\\\)**  \\n   We immediately pay +1 per such row (whole‐row op), and treat them as “boundaries” across which no 2×2 block may cross.\\n\\n2. **Segments with \\\\(0\\\\le a_i\\\\le4\\\\)**  \\n   Within each segment, a row \\\\(i\\\\) has at most 4 black cells, so we define  \\n   \\\\[\\n     b_i = \\\\Bigl\\\\lceil \\\\frac{a_i}{2}\\\\Bigr\\\\rceil\\\\quad(\\\\in\\\\{0,1,2\\\\}).\\n   \\\\]  \\n   We may place at most one 2×2 block between rows \\\\(i\\\\) and \\\\(i+1\\\\) if both rows have \\\\(\\\\ge2\\\\) black cells (so that block actually covers black cells).
