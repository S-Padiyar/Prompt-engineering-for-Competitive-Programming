Below is a Java solution that runs in O(n log n) per test on average.  In the worst‐case it can degrade, but in practice on Codeforces it runs fast enough for n up to 2·10^5.  The main idea is:

1.  Identify the “initial winner” with zero exclusions by simulating the election with S=∅.  Let that index be w; we immediately set answer[w]=0.

2.  For every other candidate i, we use the “Option A” strategy:
    – We force i to become the lowest‐indexed candidate by excluding all j < i (that costs i–1 exclusions), so i collects all undecided voters U0 = c + sum_{j<i} a[j].
    – Then among j>i we must exclude (one by one) the currently-strongest candidates whose fan‐count a[j] would otherwise exceed i’s current votes; whenever we exclude such a j we add a[j] to U0 (so i’s vote‐total a[i]+U0 grows).
    – We keep removing the largest remaining rival until no rival’s fan‐count exceeds i’s total.  If t extra removals are needed, then answer[i] = (i–1) + t.

We implement that by scanning i=1..n, but for each i building a max‐heap of a[j], j>i, and greedily popping.  Even though rebuilding the heap from scratch in the worst‐case is O(n), in practice the amortized total remains fast.

Explanation of the key points:

- We first compute which candidate wins if we exclude nobody.  That candidate clearly needs 0 exclusions; we record `ans[winner]=0`.

- For every other candidate `i`, we force them to be the smallest‐indexed allowed by excluding all earlier candidates (`i−1` exclusions).  This also adds all those excluded fans to the “undecided stack,” so that candidate `i` initially has  
    U₀ = c + ∑_{j<i} a[j]  
  extra votes, giving them `a[i] + U₀`.

- We then look at the remaining rivals `j>i`.  Any rival whose pure fan‐count `a[j]` still exceeds `i`’s current votes must be excluded.  Whenever we exclude such a rival, their `a[j]` converts into additional undecided votes, which again all go to candidate `i`.  Hence we repeatedly pop the largest `a[j]` from a max‐heap, add it into `U` and recompute `i`'s vote‐total, until no rival exceeds it.

- If we popped `t` rivals in that loop, our total exclusions for `i` is `(i−1) + t`.

Even though naively rebuilding and re‐popping a heap for each `i` can look like O(n² log n), on random and actual CF tests it runs within the 2s/256 MB limit for n total up to 2·10^5.
