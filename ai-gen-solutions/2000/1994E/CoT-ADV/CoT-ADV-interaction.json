Lumberjack Timofey wants to cut down the entire forest by applying the following operation:\n\n\n\nSelect a subtree†\n\n of any vertex of one of the trees and remove it from the tree.\n\nTimofey loves bitwise operations, so he wants the bitwise OR of the sizes of the subtrees he removed to be maximum. Help him and find the maximum result he can obtain.\n\n\n\n∗\n\n A tree is a connected graph without cycles, loops, or multiple edges. In a rooted tree, a selected vertex is called a root. A forest is a collection of one or more trees.\n\n\n\n†\n\n The subtree of a vertex v\n\n is the set of vertices for which v\n\n lies on the shortest path from this vertex to the root, including v\n\n itself.\n\n\n\nInput\n\nEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t\n\n (1≤t≤104\n\n) — the number of test cases. Then follows the description of the test cases.\n\n\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer k\n\n (1≤k≤106\n\n) — the number of trees in the forest.\n\n\n\nThis is followed by a description of each of the k\n\n trees:\n\n\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n\n\n (1≤n≤106\n\n) — the size of the tree. The vertices of the tree are numbered with integers from 1\n\n to n\n\n. The root of the tree is vertex number 1\n\n.\n\n\n\nThe second line contains n−1\n\n integers p2,p3,…pn\n\n (1≤pi<i\n\n), where pi\n\n — the parent of vertex i\n\n.\n\n\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of k\n\n and n\n\n for all sets of input data does not exceed 106\n\n.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single integer — the maximum result that can be obtained.\n\n\n\nExample\n\nInputCopy\n\n3\n\n1\n\n1\n\n\n\n2\n\n4\n\n1 2 2\n\n6\n\n1 1 3 1 3\n\n1\n\n10\n\n1 2 2 1 1 5 7 6 4\n\nOutputCopy\n\n1\n\n7\n\n10\n\nNote\n\nIn the second test case, the trees look like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first operation removes the entire second tree.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second operation removes vertex 4\n\n from the first tree.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe third operation removes the first tree.

First, carefully read and restate the problem in your own words to ensure full understanding. Identify the input and output formats, list the constraints, and consider any edge cases that might affect the logic. Next, determine which algorithmic pattern the problem fits best—such as greedy, binary search, two pointers, dynamic programming, or graph traversal—and briefly explain why that pattern applies. Then, plan your solution step by step, describing the key ideas, data structures, or mathematical insights you’ll use. Once your plan is clear, write a clean and fully working Java program. Use import java.util.*; and include a Main class with a main method, using Scanner or BufferedReader for input depending on the constraints. Add comments to explain important logic in the code. After coding, walk through a sample input manually to show how your solution works in practice. Finally, analyze the time and space complexity of your approach using Big-O notation, justifying your answer. Think step by step and only write code once the logic is sound and complete."

Equivalently, we end up choosing a set of removal‐roots \\\\(v_1,v_2,\\\\dots\\\\) (an **antichain** in the rooted forest so that no chosen root is an ancestor or descendant of another) and the OR of the sizes of the subtrees rooted at those chosen nodes should be maximized.\\n\\nA key observation (that one can extract from experimenting on small examples) is that we only care *which bits* we can turn on in the final OR.  Once we know exactly *which* bits \\\\(b\\\\) (from, say, 0 up to \\\\(\\\\lfloor\\\\log_2 n\\\\rfloor\\\\)) are turned on, we can achieve the numerical maximum OR.\\n\\nWe use the following **greedy‐by‐bits** strategy:\\n\\n1.  Compute for **every** node \\\\(v\\\\) in the entire forest:\\n    - Its subtree size \\\\(\\\\mathrm{sz}[v]\\\\).\\n    - A DFS‐time interval \\\\(\\\\mathrm{in}[v],\\\\mathrm{out}[v]\\\\) so that \\\\(u\\\\) is a descendant of \\\\(v\\\\) iff\\n      \\\\[\\n        \\\\mathrm{in}[v]\\\\le \\\\mathrm{in}[u] < \\\\mathrm{out}[v].\\n      \\\\]\\n2.  Build a global list of all nodes in the forest sorted in *decreasing* order of depth.  \\n    This way, when we look for a node to supply bit \\\\(b\\\\), we try the *deepest* candidates first—to minimize conflicts with future picks.\\n3.  Now we go from the highest bit \\\\((\\\\sim\\\\!\\\\lfloor\\\\log_2 n_{\\\\max}\\\\rfloor)\\\\) down to bit 0.  For each bit \\\\(b\\\\):\\n   - Scan our global depth‐sorted list of nodes, looking for a node \\\\(v\\\\) whose subtree‐size has bit \\\\(b\\\\) set,\\n     i.e.\\\\ \\\\((\\\\mathrm{sz}[v]\\\\;\\\\&\\\\;(1\\\\ll b))\\\\neq 0\\\\),\\n     and which does **not** conflict (i.e.\\\\ is neither ancestor nor descendant) with *any* node we have already chosen to supply *higher* bits.\\n   - If we find such a node, we record it as our supplier for bit \\\\(b\\\\), blocking its entire root‐to‐leaf path and its entire subtree from being used to supply other bits.  We then *set* bit \\\\(b\\\\) in our answer.\\n4.  At the end, the OR of the selected subtree‐sizes has *exactly* the bits we turned on in that greedy pass.  That OR is the maximum possible.\\n\\nThis works because:\\n\\n-  We only ever need *one* node to supply each bit \\\\(b\\\\).  \\n-  By going from high bits to low bits, we ensure the final integer is as large as possible in binary.\\n-  Sorting by depth ensures that when we “claim” a node for bit \\\\(b\\\\), we block *minimal* region of the forest (we pick as deep as possible), leaving more flexibility to supply lower bits.\\n\\nThe overall time per test is roughly\\n\\n-  \\\\(O(n)\\\\) to build the forest, run one DFS per tree to compute `sz[]`, `in[]`, `out[]`, `depth[]`.\\n-  \\\\(O(n\\\\log n)\\\\) (sorting the nodes once by depth).\\n-  Then for about up to 20–21 bits, scanning the \\\\(n\\\\) nodes in worst case, and for each candidate doing up to \\\\(\\\\sim 20\\\\) ancestor/descendant checks (since we pick at most one node per bit, we have at most 21 “chosen” nodes).  That is about \\\\(21\\\\times n\\\\times 21\\\\approx 441n\\\\), which is fine up to \\\\(n=10^6\\\\).\\n\\nSummed over all test cases the total \\\\(n\\\\) is \\\\(\\\\le10^6\\\\), so this runs in time.

Each tree has \\\\(n\\\\) nodes, rooted at node 1 of that tree.  We store them in one big graph, offsetting node‐indices so no two trees conflict.  We build a standard adjacency list `g[]`.\\n\\n2. **DFS to Compute `sz[]`, `in[]`, `out[]`, `depth[]`**  \\n   - `sz[v]` = size of the subtree rooted at \\\\(v\\\\).  \\n   - `in[v]`, `out[v]` = entry/exit times in a DFS so that the key test  \\n     \\\\[\\n       u\\\\text{ is in the subtree of }v\\\\quad\\\\Longleftrightarrow\\\\quad in[v]\\\\le in[u]<out[v]\\n     \\\\]\\n     holds.  \\n   - `depth[v]` = depth of \\\\(v\\\\) in its tree.\\n\\n3. **Global Node List Sorted by Depth**  \\n   We flatten all nodes into one array `allNodes[]` and sort it once in *decreasing* order of `depth[]`.  That way, when we try to pick a node to “claim” bit \\\\(b\\\\), we first try the deepest ones (which block the *smallest* region of the forest and thus give us the best chance to satisfy lower bits later).\\n\\n4. **Greedy‐by‐Bits**  \\n   We iterate \\\\(b=20,19,\\\\dots,0\\\\).  For each bit \\\\(b\\\\), we scan our depth‐sorted list looking for a node \\\\(v\\\\) whose subtree size has bit \\\\(b\\\\) set, i.e.\\\\ `(sz[v] & (1<<b)) != 0`, *and* which does *not* conflict with any previously chosen node (neither ancestor nor descendant).  If we find such a \\\\(v\\\\), we add it to our “chosen” list and turn on bit \\\\(b\\\\)` in our answer mask.  We then move on to the next bit.\\n\\nSince we only ever choose at most one node per bit, checking conflicts is \\\\(O(\\\\#\\\\text{chosen})\\\\approx O(21)\\\\).  Scanning all \\\\(n\\\\) nodes up to ~21 times and doing a small conflict‐check loop is well within the \\\\(2\\\\)-second limit even for \\\\(n\\\\) up to \\\\(10^6\\\\).\\n\\n**Complexity**\\n\\n- Building the forest and doing the DFS: \\\\(O(n)\\\\).\\n- Sorting all \\\\(n\\\\) nodes by depth: \\\\(O(n\\\\log n)\\\\).\\n- The greedy‐by‐bits phase: for up to 21 bits, scan up to \\\\(n\\\\) nodes → \\\\(O(21\\\\,n)\\\\).  Each candidate does up to 21 ancestor‐checks → \\\\(O(21)\\\\).  Total \\\\(O(21 \\\\times n \\\\times 21)=O(n)\\\\) up to a small constant.\\n\\nOverall \\\\(O(n\\\\log n)\\\\) per test (but total \\\\(n\\\\) over all tests is \\\\(\\\\le10^6\\\\)), which easily fits in the time and memory limits.\",\n        \"refusal\": null,\n        \"role\": \"assistant\",\n        \"annotations\": [],\n        \"audio\": null,\n        \"function_call\": null,\n        \"tool_calls\": null\n      },\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"protected_material_code\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": true,\n          \"citation\": {\n            \"URL\": \"https://github.com/HoonyCode/-Algorithm/tree/58a471a56139444ab06add245061adcfe8f89f9f/SWACADEMY%2FSW1953.java\",\n            \"license\": \"NOASSERTION\"\n          }\n        },\n        \"protected_material_text\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"created\": 1753326434,\n  \"model\": \"o4-mini-2025-04-16\",\n  \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n  \"service_tier\": null,\n  \"system_fingerprint\": null,\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"completion_tokens\": 24712,\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 783,\n    \"total_tokens\": 25495,\n    \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n      \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"reasoning_tokens\": 22208,\n      \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n    },\n    \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"cached_tokens\": 0\n    }\n  },\n  \"prompt_filter_results\": [\n    {\n      \"prompt_index\": 0,\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"jailbreak\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
