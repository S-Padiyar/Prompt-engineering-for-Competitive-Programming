Sakurako has prepared a task for you:

She gives you an array of n
 integers and allows you to choose i
 and j
 such that i≠j
 and ai≥aj
, and then assign ai=ai−aj
 or ai=ai+aj
. You can perform this operation any number of times for any i
 and j
, as long as they satisfy the conditions.

Sakurako asks you what is the maximum possible value of mexk
∗
 of the array after any number of operations.

∗
mexk
 is the k
-th non-negative integer that is absent in the array. For example, mex1({1,2,3})=0
, since 0
 is the first element that is not in the array, and mex2({0,2,4})=3
, since 3
 is the second element that is not in the array.

Input
The first line contains a single integer t
 (1≤t≤104
)  — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n
 and k
 (1≤n≤2⋅105,1≤k≤109
)  — the number of elements in the array and the value k
 for mexk
.

The second line of each test case contains n
 integers a1,a2,…,an
 (1≤ai≤109
)  — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n
 across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105
.

Output
For each test case, output the maximum mexk
 that can be achieved through the operations.
