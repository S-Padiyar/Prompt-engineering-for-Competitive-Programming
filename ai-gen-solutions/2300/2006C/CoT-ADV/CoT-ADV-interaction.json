Eri and Expanded Sets\n\ntime limit per test3 seconds\n\nmemory limit per test512 megabytes\n\nLet there be a set that contains distinct positive integers. To expand the set to contain as many integers as possible, Eri can choose two integers x≠y\n\n from the set such that their average x+y2\n\n is still a positive integer and isn't contained in the set, and add it to the set. The integers x\n\n and y\n\n remain in the set.\n\n\n\nLet's call the set of integers consecutive if, after the elements are sorted, the difference between any pair of adjacent elements is 1\n\n. For example, sets {2}\n\n, {2,5,4,3}\n\n, {5,6,8,7}\n\n are consecutive, while {2,4,5,6}\n\n, {9,7}\n\n are not.\n\n\n\nEri likes consecutive sets. Suppose there is an array b\n\n, then Eri puts all elements in b\n\n into the set. If after a finite number of operations described above, the set can become consecutive, the array b\n\n will be called brilliant.\n\n\n\nNote that if the same integer appears in the array multiple times, we only put it into the set once, as a set always contains distinct positive integers.\n\n\n\nEri has an array a\n\n of n\n\n positive integers. Please help him to count the number of pairs of integers (l,r)\n\n such that 1≤l≤r≤n\n\n and the subarray al,al+1,…,ar\n\n is brilliant.\n\n\n\nInput\n\nEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t\n\n (1≤t≤104\n\n) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.\n\n\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer n\n\n (1≤n≤4⋅105\n\n) — length of the array a\n\n.\n\n\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n\n\n integers a1,a2,…an\n\n (1≤ai≤109\n\n) — the elements of the array a\n\n.\n\n\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n\n\n over all test cases doesn't exceed 4⋅105\n\n.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single integer — the number of brilliant subarrays.\n\n\n\nExample\n\nInputCopy\n\n6\n\n2\n\n2 2\n\n6\n\n1 3 6 10 15 21\n\n5\n\n6 30 18 36 9\n\n1\n\n1000000000\n\n6\n\n1 1 4 5 1 4\n\n12\n\n70 130 90 90 90 108 612 500 451 171 193 193\n\nOutputCopy\n\n3\n\n18\n\n5\n\n1\n\n18\n\n53\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, the array a=[2,2]\n\n has 3\n\n subarrays: [2]\n\n, [2]\n\n, and [2,2]\n\n. For all of them, the set only contains a single integer 2\n\n, therefore it's always consecutive. All these subarrays are brilliant, so the answer is 3\n\n.\n\n\n\nIn the second test case, let's consider the subarray [3,6,10]\n\n. We can do operations as follows:\n\n\n\n{3,6,10}−→−−−−x=6,y=10{3,6,8,10}−→−−−−x=6,y=8{3,6,7,8,10}−→−−−−x=3,y=7{3,5,6,7,8,10}\n\n−→−−−−x=3,y=5{3,4,5,6,7,8,10}−→−−−−x=8,y=10{3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}\n\n{3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}\n\n is a consecutive set, so the subarray [3,6,10]\n\n is brilliant.\n\n---\n\nYou are a competitive programming assistant solving Codeforces problems using Java. First, carefully read and restate the problem in your own words to ensure full understanding. Identify the input and output formats, list the constraints, and consider any edge cases that might affect the logic. Next, determine which algorithmic pattern the problem fits best—such as greedy, binary search, two pointers, dynamic programming, or graph traversal—and briefly explain why that pattern applies. Then, plan your solution step by step, describing the key ideas, data structures, or mathematical insights you’ll use. Once your plan is clear, write a clean and fully working Java program. Use import java.util.*; and include a Main class with a main method, using Scanner or BufferedReader for input depending on the constraints. Add comments to explain important logic in the code. After coding, walk through a sample input manually to show how your solution works in practice. Finally, analyze the time and space complexity of your approach using Big-O notation, justifying your answer. Think step by step and only write code once the logic is sound and complete."

Concretely we keep a small list of pairs\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\bigl(g_1,c_1\\\\bigr),\\\\bigl(g_2,c_2\\\\bigr),\\\\dots,\\n\\\\]\\n\\nwhere \\\\(g_j\\\\) is a GCD value and \\\\(c_j\\\\) counts how many subarrays ending at \\\\(i\\\\) have GCD exactly \\\\(g_j\\\\).  There are only \\\\(O(\\\\log(\\\\max b_i))\\\\) such GCD‐values at any position, because each time you extend a subarray its GCD can only drop by dividing out prime factors, and there are at most \\\\(\\\\log\\\\) many distinct divisors in a gcd‐chain.\\n\\nWhen we move from position \\\\(i-1\\\\) to \\\\(i\\\\), we form a new list for “ending at \\\\(i\\\\)” by\\n\\n1.  Starting with the single‐element new subarray \\\\([i,i]\\\\), which has GCD \\\\(b_i\\\\), so we add \\\\((b_i,1)\\\\).\\n\\n2.  For each old pair \\\\((g,c)\\\\) from “ending at \\\\(i-1\\\\)”, compute \\\\(\\\\gcd(g,b_i)\\\\); that value also appears with multiplicity \\\\(c\\\\).  We merge runs of the same gcd‐value to keep the list small.\\n\\nAfter building the new list, we simply add up the counts \\\\(c_j\\\\) for those \\\\(g_j\\\\) which are powers of two (including \\\\(g_j=0\\\\), since \\\\(0\\\\) & \\\\((0-1)\\\\)==0 in bit‐logic, so we get it “for free” by the usual test `(g & (g-1)) == 0`).\\n\\nFinally, we add \\\\(n\\\\) (the number of length-1 subarrays of \\\\(a\\\\)), and print the result.\\n\\nThis runs in \\\\(O\\\\bigl(n\\\\log(\\\\max a_i)\\\\bigr)\\\\), which is perfectly fine for \\\\(n\\\\le4\\\\cdot10^5\\\\).\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Java Implementation**\\n\\n```java\\nimport java.io.*;\\nimport java.util.*;\\n\\npublic class Main {\\n    // Fast GCD\\n    private static int gcd(int a, int b) {\\n        while (b != 0) {\\n            int t = a % b;\\n            a = b;\\n            b = t;\\n        }\\n        return a < 0 ? -a : a;\\n    }\\n\\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\\n        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));\\n        StringTokenizer st;\\n        int t = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine());\\n\\n        // We will reuse these small arrays for the dynamic-programming state\\n        // Since the number of distinct gcds per position is O(log A), ~< 32\\n        int MAXS = 64;\\n        int[] prevG = new int[MAXS], curG = new int[MAXS];\\n        long[] prevCnt = new long[MAXS], curCnt = new long[MAXS];\\n\\n        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\\n        while (t-- > 0) {\\n            int n = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine());\\n            st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\\n            int[] a = new int[n];\\n            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\\n                a[i] = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\\n            }\\n\\n            // Edge case: length 1\\n            if (n == 1) {\\n                sb.append(1).append('\\\\n');\\n                continue;\\n            }\\n\\n            // Build the adjacent-differences array b of length n-1\\n            int[] b = new int[n - 1];\\n            for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {\\n                b[i] = Math.abs(a[i + 1] - a[i]);\\n            }\\n\\n            // We'll accumulate the count of \\\"good\\\" subarrays of b (length >= 1)\\n            long goodSubB = 0;\\n\\n            // \\\"prev\\\" list is initially empty (no subarrays ending at -1)\\n            int prevSize = 0;\\n\\n            // Sweep b from left to right\\n            for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {\\n                int x = b[i];\\n                int curSize = 0;\\n\\n                // 1) Start with the single-element subarray [i..i]\\n                curG[curSize] = x;\\n                curCnt[curSize] = 1;\\n                curSize++;\\n\\n                // 2) Extend all old subarrays by b[i]\\n                for (int j = 0; j < prevSize; j++) {\\n                    int g = gcd(prevG[j], x);\\n                    long c = prevCnt[j];\\n                    // Merge runs of the same gcd\\n                    if (curG[curSize - 1] == g) {\\n                        curCnt[curSize - 1] += c;\\n                    } else {\\n                        curG[curSize] = g;\\n                        curCnt[curSize] = c;\\n                        curSize++;\\n                    }\\n                }\\n\\n                // 3) Count how many of these have gcd a power of two (or zero)\\n                for (int j = 0; j < curSize; j++) {\\n                    int g = curG[j];\\n                    // Test \\\"power-of-two or zero\\\" by (g & (g-1)) == 0\\n                    if ((g & (g - 1)) == 0) {\\n                        goodSubB += curCnt[j];\\n                    }\\n                }\\n\\n                // 4) Move cur → prev for the next iteration\\n                System.arraycopy(curG, 0, prevG, 0, curSize);\\n                System.arraycopy(curCnt, 0, prevCnt, 0, curSize);\\n                prevSize = curSize;\\n            }\\n\\n            // Total brilliant subarrays of a = singletons (n)\\n            //                                  + good subarrays of b (length>=1)\\n            long answer = n + goodSubB;\\n            sb.append(answer).append('\\\\n');\\n        }\\n\\n        System.out.print(sb);\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Explanation of Key Steps**\\n\\n1. **Reduction to differences**  \\n   A subarray \\\\(a[\\\\ell..r]\\\\) is brilliant precisely when  \\n   \\\\(\\\\gcd\\\\bigl(|a_i - a_\\\\ell|\\\\bigr)\\\\) over \\\\(i=\\\\ell,\\\\dots,r\\\\)  \\n   is a power of two (or zero).

When we append a new element \\\\(b[i]\\\\), each old gcd \\\\(g\\\\) turns into \\\\(\\\\gcd(g,b[i])\\\\), and we also get the one-element subarray whose gcd is just \\\\(b[i]\\\\).  We merge runs of identical gcds to keep the list short (\\\\(O(\\\\log A)\\\\) distinct values).  Then we simply add up the counts of those runs whose gcd is a power of two.\\n\\n3. **Singleton subarrays**  \\n   Every single element of \\\\(a\\\\) (length-1 subarray) is automatically brilliant (the set has zero difference, gcd = 0), so we add \\\\(n\\\\) at the end.\\n\\nOverall complexity: \\\\(O\\\\bigl(n\\\\,\\\\log(\\\\max a_i)\\\\bigr)\\\\), which easily handles up to \\\\(n=4\\\\cdot10^5\\\\). \\n\\n---\\n\\n**Time and Space Complexity**\\n\\n- **Time**  \\n  We do one pass over the \\\\(n-1\\\\) entries of \\\\(b\\\\).  At each step we merge at most \\\\(O(\\\\log A)\\\\) old gcd‐collections, and do one gcd per old entry.  Hence \\\\(O\\\\bigl(n\\\\log(\\\\max a_i)\\\\bigr)\\\\).\\n\\n- **Space**  \\n  We use only \\\\(O(\\\\log A)\\\\) temporary state at each step, plus the input arrays of size \\\\(O(n)\\\\).
