Penchick and Chloe's Trees\n\ntime limit per test3.5 seconds\n\nmemory limit per test512 megabytes\n\n\n\nWith just a few hours left until Penchick and Chloe leave for Singapore, they could hardly wait to see the towering trees at the Singapore Botanic Gardens! Attempting to contain their excitement, Penchick crafted a rooted tree to keep Chloe and himself busy.\n\n\n\nPenchick has a rooted tree∗\n\n consisting of n\n\n vertices, numbered from 1\n\n to n\n\n, with vertex 1\n\n as the root, and Chloe can select a non-negative integer d\n\n to create a perfect binary tree†\n\n of depth d\n\n.\n\n\n\nSince Penchick and Chloe are good friends, Chloe wants her tree to be isomorphic‡\n\n to Penchick's tree. To meet this condition, Chloe can perform the following operation on her own tree any number of times:\n\n\n\nSelect an edge (u,v)\n\n, where u\n\n is the parent of v\n\n.\n\nRemove vertex v\n\n and all the edges connected to v\n\n, then connect all of v\n\n's previous children directly to u\n\n.\n\nIn particular, doing an operation on an edge (u,v)\n\n where v\n\n is a leaf will delete vertex v\n\n without adding any new edges.\n\n\n\nSince constructing a perfect binary tree can be time-consuming, Chloe wants to choose the minimum d\n\n such that a perfect binary tree of depth d\n\n can be made isomorphic to Penchick's tree using the above operation. Note that she can't change the roots of the trees.\n\n\n\n∗\n\nA tree is a connected graph without cycles. A rooted tree is a tree where one vertex is special and called the root. The parent of vertex v\n\n is the first vertex on the simple path from v\n\n to the root. The root has no parent. A child of vertex v\n\n is any vertex u\n\n for which v\n\n is the parent. A leaf is any vertex without children.\n\n\n\n†\n\nA full binary tree is rooted tree, in which each node has 0\n\n or 2\n\n children. A perfect binary tree is a full binary tree in which every leaf is at the same distance from the root. The depth of such a tree is the distance from the root to a leaf.\n\n\n\n‡\n\nTwo rooted trees, rooted at r1\n\n and r2\n\n respectively, are considered isomorphic if there exists a permutation p\n\n of the vertices such that an edge (u,v)\n\n exists in the first tree if and only if the edge (pu,pv)\n\n exists in the second tree, and pr1=r2\n\n.\n\n\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t\n\n (1≤t≤105\n\n). The description of the test cases follows.\n\n\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer n\n\n (2≤n≤106\n\n) — the number of vertices in Penchick's tree.\n\n\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n−1\n\n integers p2,p3,…,pn\n\n (1≤pi≤i−1\n\n) — the parent of vertex i\n\n.\n\n\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n\n\n over all test cases does not exceed 106\n\n.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single integer on each line: the minimum depth of Chloe's perfect binary tree.\n\n\n\nExample\n\nInputCopy\n\n5\n\n6\n\n1 2 2 1 1\n\n15\n\n1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 5 6 6 7 7\n\n5\n\n1 2 2 2\n\n7\n\n1 1 2 1 1 2\n\n10\n\n1 1 1 2 2 2 4 3 3\n\nOutputCopy\n\n2\n\n3\n\n3\n\n3\n\n3\n\nNote\n\nFor the first test case, create a perfect binary tree with depth 2\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider carrying out the operation on edge AC\n\n. Then the edges AC\n\n, CF\n\n, and CG\n\n are removed, and edges AF\n\n and AG\n\n are added.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe resulting tree is isomorphic to the tree given in the input. It can be proven that no sequence of operations carried out on a binary tree of depth less than 2\n\n can lead to a tree isomorphic to the tree given in the input.\n\n\n\nIn the second test case, the tree is already isomorphic to a perfect binary tree of depth 3\n\n.\n\n---\n\nUse Java."

Since a perfect binary tree has exactly \\\\(2^d\\\\) nodes at depth \\\\(d\\\\), and node‐contraction is exactly the greedy matching of subtrees to these positions, it reduces to the classical “schedule \\\\(k\\\\) tasks with deadlines \\\\(d_i\\\\) on a machine that has capacity \\\\(2^1\\\\) at time \\\\(1\\\\), \\\\(2^2\\\\) at time \\\\(2\\\\), …, \\\\(2^H\\\\) at time \\\\(H\\\\).”\\n\\n  A standard necessary‐and‐sufficient check is to sort the deadlines \\\\(d_i\\\\) in ascending order and verify that by the \\\\(j\\\\)th deadline \\\\(d_j\\\\) you have used no more than\\n  \\\\[\\n     \\\\underbrace{2^1 + 2^2 + \\\\cdots + 2^{d_j}}_{=2^{d_j+1}-2}\\n  \\\\]\\n  slots.\\n\\nThus we do a bottom‐up DP on \\\\(T\\\\):\\n\\n1.  Build the child‐adjacency for \\\\(T\\\\).\\n2.  Process nodes in *reverse child‐count* order (leaves first).  You can do that by initializing a queue with all leaves, then each time you “finish” a node \\\\(u\\\\), you push its parent once *all* of the parent’s children are done.\\n3.

The answer for the whole tree is \\\\(\\\\text{need}[1]\\\\).\\n\\nEach node’s processing takes\\n- sorting \\\\(\\\\deg(u)\\\\) integers,\\n- a little arithmetic to set up a binary‐search range,\\n- \\\\(O(\\\\log N_u)\\\\) trial‐checks, each \\\\(O(\\\\deg(u))\\\\),\\n\\nwhere \\\\(N_u\\\\) is the number of children of \\\\(u\\\\).

By contracting the path from the root down to some node at depth \\\\(d\\\\), one can make that node a *direct* child of the root in the final contracted tree, at the cost of “burning” those \\\\(d\\\\) levels.  To support a child‐subtree of height `need[v_i]`, you must pick depth \\\\(d\\\\le H-\\\\text{need}[v_i]\\\\).  Thus each child‐subtree becomes a “task with deadline”  \\n   \\\\[\\n      d_i = H \\\\;-\\\\;\\\\text{need}[v_i].\\n   \\\\]\\n   We have total capacity at depth \\\\(1\\\\) equal to \\\\(2^1\\\\), at depth \\\\(2\\\\) equal to \\\\(2^2\\\\), …, at depth \\\\(d\\\\) equal to \\\\(\\\\sum_{j=1}^d2^j=2^{d+1}-2\\\\).  The standard greedy check for scheduling with deadlines says that, after sorting deadlines in ascending order, by the \\\\(j\\\\)-th deadline \\\\(d_j\\\\) we must have used no more than \\\\(\\\\sum_{r=1}^{d_j}2^r\\\\) slots.\\n\\n3. **Bottom‐up DP without recursion.**  \\n   - We store for each node \\\\(u\\\\) its list of children via a classic forward‐star adjacency.  \\n   - We keep a counter `deg[u]` = # of children of \\\\(u\\\\).  Initialize a queue with all leaves (those with `deg[u]==0`).  \\n   - Repeatedly pop a node \\\\(u\\\\) from the queue, compute `need[u]` by the above “sort + binary‐search the smallest \\\\(H\\\\) that schedules,” then decrement `deg[parent[u]]`; if that drops to zero we push the parent.  \\n   - Eventually we compute `need[1]`, which is the minimum depth \\\\(d\\\\) Chloe needs.\\n\\nThis runs in \\\\(O\\\\bigl(\\\\sum_{u}\\\\deg(u)\\\\log \\\\deg(u)\\\\bigr)\\\\approx O(n\\\\log n)\\\\) overall and easily handles \\\\(n\\\\) up to \\\\(10^6\\\\).\",\n        \"refusal\": null,\n        \"role\": \"assistant\",\n        \"annotations\": [],\n        \"audio\": null,\n        \"function_call\": null,\n        \"tool_calls\": null\n      },\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"protected_material_code\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"protected_material_text\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"created\": 1753310088,\n  \"model\": \"o4-mini-2025-04-16\",\n  \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n  \"service_tier\": null,\n  \"system_fingerprint\": null,\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"completion_tokens\": 15044,\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 928,\n    \"total_tokens\": 15972,\n    \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n      \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"reasoning_tokens\": 12160,\n      \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n    },\n    \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"cached_tokens\": 0\n    }\n  },\n  \"prompt_filter_results\": [\n    {\n      \"prompt_index\": 0,\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"jailbreak\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
