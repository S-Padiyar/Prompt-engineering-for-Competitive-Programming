D. Colored Portals
time limit per test2 seconds
memory limit per test256 megabytes
There are n
 cities located on a straight line. The cities are numbered from 1
 to n
.

Portals are used to move between cities. There are 4
 colors of portals: blue, green, red, and yellow. Each city has portals of two different colors. You can move from city i
 to city j
 if they have portals of the same color (for example, you can move between a "blue-red" city and a "blue-green" city). This movement costs |i−j|
 coins.

Your task is to answer q
 independent queries: calculate the minimum cost to move from city x
 to city y
.

Input
The first line contains a single integer t
 (1≤t≤104
) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n
 and q
 (1≤n,q≤2⋅105
) — the number of cities and the number of queries, respectively.

The second line contains n
 strings of the following types: BG, BR, BY, GR, GY, or RY; the i
-th of them describes the portals located in the i
-th city; the symbol B indicates that there is a blue portal in the city, G — green, R — red, and Y — yellow.

The j
-th of the next q
 lines contains two integers xj
 and yj
 (1≤xj,yj≤n
) — the description of the j
-th query.

Additional constraints on the input:

the sum of n
 over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105
;
the sum of q
 over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105
.
Output
For each query, print a single integer — the minimum cost to move from city x
 to city y
 (or −1
 if it is impossible).
