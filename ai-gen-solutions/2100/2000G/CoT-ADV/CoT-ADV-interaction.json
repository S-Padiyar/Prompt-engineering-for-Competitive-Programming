Call During the Journey\n\ntime limit per test4 seconds\n\nmemory limit per test256 megabytes\n\nYou live in a city consisting of n\n\n intersections and m\n\n streets connecting some pairs of intersections. You can travel in either direction on each street. No two streets connect the same pair of intersections, and no street connects an intersection to itself. You can reach any intersection from any other, possibly passing through some other intersections.\n\n\n\nEvery minute, you can board a bus at intersection ui\n\n and travel for li1\n\n minutes to intersection vi\n\n. Conversely, you can travel from intersection vi\n\n to intersection ui\n\n in li1\n\n minutes. You can only board and exit the bus at intersections. You can only board the bus at an intersection if you are currently there.\n\n\n\nYou can also walk along each street, which takes li2>li1\n\n minutes.\n\n\n\nYou can make stops at intersections.\n\n\n\nYou live at intersection number 1\n\n. Today you woke up at time 0\n\n, and you have an important event scheduled at intersection number n\n\n, which you must reach no later than time t0\n\n. You also have a phone call planned that will last from t1\n\n to t2\n\n minutes (t1<t2<t0\n\n).\n\n\n\nDuring the phone call, you cannot ride the bus, but you can walk along any streets, make stops, or stay at home. You can exit the bus at minute t1\n\n and board the bus again at minute t2\n\n.\n\n\n\nSince you want to get enough sleep, you became curious — how late can you leave home to have time to talk on the phone and still not be late for the event?\n\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t\n\n (1≤t≤104\n\n) — the number of test cases. The following are the descriptions of the test cases.\n\n\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers n\n\n, m\n\n (2≤n≤105,1≤m≤105\n\n) — the number of intersections and streets in the city.\n\n\n\nThe second line of each test case contains three integers t0\n\n, t1\n\n, t2\n\n (1≤t1<t2<t0≤109\n\n) — the start time of the event, the start time of the phone call, and its end time, respectively.\n\n\n\nThe next m\n\n lines of each test case contain descriptions of the streets.\n\n\n\nThe i\n\n-th line contains four integers ui\n\n, vi\n\n, li1\n\n, li2\n\n (1≤ui,vi≤n\n\n, ui≠vi\n\n, 1≤li1<li2≤109\n\n) — the numbers of the intersections connected by the i\n\n-th street, as well as the travel time along the street by bus and on foot. It is guaranteed that no two streets connect the same pair of intersections and that it is possible to reach any intersection from any other.\n\n\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n\n\n across all test cases does not exceed 105\n\n. It is also guaranteed that the sum of the values of m\n\n across all test cases does not exceed 105\n\n.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single integer — the latest time you can leave home to have time to talk on the phone and not be late for the event.

First, carefully read and restate the problem in your own words to ensure full understanding. Identify the input and output formats, list the constraints, and consider any edge cases that might affect the logic. Next, determine which algorithmic pattern the problem fits best—such as greedy, binary search, two pointers, dynamic programming, or graph traversal—and briefly explain why that pattern applies. Then, plan your solution step by step, describing the key ideas, data structures, or mathematical insights you’ll use. Once your plan is clear, write a clean and fully working Java program. Use import java.util.*; and include a Main class with a main method, using Scanner or BufferedReader for input depending on the constraints. Add comments to explain important logic in the code. After coding, walk through a sample input manually to show how your solution works in practice. Finally, analyze the time and space complexity of your approach using Big-O notation, justifying your answer. Think step by step and only write code once the logic is sound and complete."

Each street \\\\((u,v)\\\\) has two travel‐time weights:\\n\\n- \\\\(l_1\\\\): time by bus (\\\\(1 \\\\le l_1 < l_2 \\\\le 10^9\\\\)),  \\n- \\\\(l_2\\\\): time by walking.\\n\\nYou live at node \\\\(1\\\\), need to be at node \\\\(n\\\\) no later than **absolute** time \\\\(t_0\\\\).  You also have a phone call from time \\\\(t_1\\\\) to \\\\(t_2\\\\) (\\\\(1 \\\\le t_1 < t_2 < t_0 \\\\le 10^9\\\\)), *during which you cannot be riding any bus*.  You can walk or wait at intersections during that interval.\\n\\nYou want to **delay** your departure from home (node 1) as long as possible (call that departure time \\\\(S\\\\ge0\\\\)) and still reach node \\\\(n\\\\) by time \\\\(t_0\\\\).  Output the maximum \\\\(S\\\\), or \\\\(-1\\\\) if it’s impossible even when you leave at time 0.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Key Observations and Algorithm**\\n\\n1. **Time‐Dependent Bus Availability**  \\n   A bus‐ride of length \\\\(l_1\\\\) can only be scheduled if its entire travel segment does **not** overlap the forbidden interval \\\\([t_1,t_2]\\\\).  However:\\n   - You may **wait** at an intersection before boarding the bus;  \\n   - Walking (weight \\\\(l_2\\\\)) is always allowed at any time, including during \\\\([t_1,t_2]\\\\).\\n\\n2. **Dijkstra with Waiting**  \\n   We can do a shortest‐time‐to‐reach‐node\\\\(n\\\\) calculation via a **modified Dijkstra** where:\\n   - We keep a `dist[u] = earliest time we can arrive at u`.\\n   - From \\\\((u,\\\\,\\\\text{time}=d)\\\\), walking to neighbor \\\\(v\\\\) updates `d + l2` unconditionally.\\n   - For bus to \\\\(v\\\\) of length \\\\(l1\\\\):\\n     - If starting now \\\\(d\\\\) and finishing by \\\\(d+l1 \\\\le t_1\\\\), you can go immediately.\\n     - Else if \\\\(d \\\\ge t_2\\\\), you can also go immediately.\\n     - Otherwise you must **wait** until exactly \\\\(t_2\\\\) and then ride.  \\n     In code, that is:\\n       ```\\n       long depart = (d < t2 && d + l1 > t1) ? t2 : d;\\n       long arrive = depart + l1;\\n       ```\\n     and we relax `dist[v]` with `arrive`.\\n\\n3. **Feasibility Check & Monotonicity**\\n\\n   Let \\\\(f(S)\\\\) = earliest‐arrival‐time at node \\\\(n\\\\) if we *start* at time \\\\(S\\\\).  We want the **largest** \\\\(S\\\\) so that \\\\(f(S) \\\\le t_0\\\\).\\n\\n   - **Monotonic in \\\\(S\\\\)**: Leaving later can only delay or equal your arrival time (you never get to cheat time).\\n   - **Binary Search**: We binary‐search on \\\\(S\\\\) over \\\\([0,\\\\;t_0]\\\\).  For each candidate \\\\(S\\\\), we run the above Dijkstra (initializing `dist[1]=S`) and see if `dist[n] <= t0`.\\n\\n4. **Early Termination & Bound Tightening**  \\n   - First compute \\\\(f(0)\\\\).  If \\\\(f(0)>t_0\\\\), even starting at 0 you’re too late ⇒ output \\\\(-1\\\\).\\n   - Otherwise you know\\n     \\\\[\\n       S + (\\\\,\\\\text{your travel time from start 0}\\\\,)\\\\;\\\\le\\\\;t_0\\n       \\\\quad\\\\Longrightarrow\\\\quad\\n       S \\\\le t_0 - f(0).\\n     \\\\]\\n     So you can confine your binary search to \\\\([0,\\\\;t_0 - f(0)]\\\\), often dramatically shrinking the range.\\n   - As soon as the Dijkstra for a candidate \\\\(S\\\\) finds `dist[n] <= t0`, you know “it’s feasible at \\\\(S\\\\).”  We try to push higher.  Otherwise we lower \\\\(S\\\\).\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Complexity**\\n\\n- Each Dijkstra takes \\\\(O((n + m)\\\\log n)\\\\).  \\n- We do 1 Dijkstra for \\\\(f(0)\\\\) plus \\\\(O(\\\\log(t_0-f(0)))\\\\) more.  Even in the worst case \\\\(t_0\\\\le10^9\\\\), that's at most 31 more.\\n- Overall per test: \\\\(O\\\\bigl((n+m)\\\\log n\\\\cdot\\\\log t_0\\\\bigr)\\\\).  Since \\\\(\\\\sum n,\\\\sum m\\\\le10^5\\\\), this runs comfortably under the 4s limit in Java.\\n\\n---\\n\\n```java\\nimport java.io.*;\\nimport java.util.*;\\n\\npublic class Main {\\n    static class Edge {\\n        int to;\\n        int busTime, walkTime;\\n        Edge(int v, int b, int w) { to = v; busTime = b; walkTime = w; }\\n    }\\n    static final long INF = Long.MAX_VALUE / 4;\\n\\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\\n        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));\\n        StringTokenizer st;\\n\\n        int T = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine().trim());\\n        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\\n\\n        while (T-- > 0) {\\n            // Read n, m\\n            st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\\n            int n = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\\n            int m = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\\n\\n            // Read t0, t1, t2\\n            st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\\n            long t0 = Long.parseLong(st.nextToken());\\n            long t1 = Long.parseLong(st.nextToken());\\n            long t2 = Long.parseLong(st.nextToken());\\n\\n            // Build graph\\n            List<Edge>[] graph = new ArrayList[n+1];\\n            for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) graph[i] = new ArrayList<>();\\n            for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {\\n                st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\\n                int u = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\\n                int v = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\\n                int l1 = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\\n                int l2 = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\\n                graph[u].add(new Edge(v, l1, l2));\\n                graph[v].add(new Edge(u, l1, l2));\\n            }\\n\\n            // 1) Compute f(0): earliest arrival if start at time 0\\n            long f0 = dijkstraArrivalTime(n, graph, t1, t2, t0, 0L);\\n            if (f0 > t0) {\\n                // Not possible even if we start at t=0\\n                sb.append(-1).append('\\\\n');\\n                continue;\\n            }\\n\\n            // We only need to search S in [0, t0 - f0]\\n            long low = 0, high = t0 - f0, ans = 0;\\n            while (low <= high) {\\n                long mid = (low + high) / 2;\\n                // If we start at mid and still can arrive by t0, it's feasible\\n                long arrival = dijkstraArrivalTime(n, graph, t1, t2, t0, mid);\\n                if (arrival <= t0) {\\n                    ans = mid;          // feasible => try later departure\\n                    low = mid + 1;\\n                } else {\\n                    high = mid - 1;     // not feasible => depart earlier\\n                }\\n            }\\n            sb.append(ans).append('\\\\n');\\n        }\\n\\n        System.out.print(sb);\\n    }\\n\\n    /**\\n     * Run a time‐aware Dijkstra from node 1 to node n.\\n     * dist[u] = earliest time we can arrive at u.\\n     * We start at dist[1] = startTime.\\n     * walking edges (l2) always cost +l2.\\n     * bus edges (l1) cost +l1, but if the bus would overlap\\n     * [t1,t2], we wait until t2 first.\\n     *\\n     * Returns dist[n] (possibly INF).\\n     */\\n    static long dijkstraArrivalTime(int n, List<Edge>[] graph,\\n                                    long t1, long t2, long t0,\\n                                    long startTime) {\\n        long[] dist = new long[n+1];\\n        Arrays.fill(dist, INF);\\n        dist[1] = startTime;\\n\\n        // Min‐heap on (current arrival time, node)\\n        PriorityQueue<long[]> pq = new PriorityQueue<>(Comparator.comparingLong(a->a[0]));\\n        pq.offer(new long[]{startTime, 1});\\n\\n        while (!pq.isEmpty()) {\\n            long[] top = pq.poll();\\n            long curT = top[0];\\n            int u = (int)top[1];\\n            if (curT > dist[u]) continue;\\n            if (u == n) {\\n                // once we pop node n, it's its final shortest time\\n                return curT;\\n            }\\n            // If even the current time > t0, no need to expand further\\n            if (curT > t0) continue;\\n\\n            for (Edge e: graph[u]) {\\n                // 1) walking\\n                long wtime = curT + e.walkTime;\\n                if (wtime < dist[e.to]) {\\n                    dist[e.to] = wtime;\\n                    pq.offer(new long[]{wtime, e.to});\\n                }\\n                // 2) bus\\n                // if we would start now and run into the call window [t1,t2],\\n                // must wait until t2\\n                long depart = (curT < t2 && curT + e.busTime > t1) ?
