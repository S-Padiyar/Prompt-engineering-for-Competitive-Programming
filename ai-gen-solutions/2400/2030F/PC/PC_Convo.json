    "content": "**Analysis**\n\nWe want to check, for each subarray \\(b=a[\\ell..r]\\), whether it can be “peeled off” by repeatedly choosing a maximal constant run whose value still appears somewhere in the subarray, removing all its copies, and continuing until the subarray is empty.  A known necessary‐and‐sufficient condition (e.g. via an “interval–laminarity” argument) is that when you look at each value \\(v\\) in the subarray and record its first and last positions\n\\[\n    I_v = [\\,f_v,\\,g_v\\,],\n\\]\nno two of these intervals may “cross.”  Concretely a crossing would be\n\\[\n   f_u < f_v \\le g_u < g_v\\,,\n\\]\nin which case no deletion order can succeed.\n\nWe can test laminarity of **all** subarrays in a single \\(O(n\\log n)\\) “two‐pointer” sweep over left‐endpoints \\(\\ell=1,2,\\dots,n\\).  We keep a window \\([\\ell..r-1]\\) that **is** laminar, then try to extend it to \\([\\ell..r]\\).  When we add the new element \\(v=a[r]\\),\n\n 1. If \\(v\\) is new in the window, its interval is \\([r,r]\\).  A 1‐length interval cannot cross anyone, so we just insert it.\n 2. Otherwise \\(v\\)’s interval was \\([f,g_{\\rm old}]\\) and becomes \\([f,r]\\).  The only way to introduce a crossing is if there is some other interval \\([f_u,g_u]\\) with\n    \\[\n       f_u < f\n       \\quad\\text{and}\\quad\n       g_u > g_{\\rm old}.\n    \\]\n    But while we are still at window end \\(r-1\\), we know all existing \\(g_u\\le r-1<r\\).  \n    So the test reduces to:\n    \\[\n      \\max_{\\,1\\le i<f}\\,M[i]\\;>\\;g_{\\rm old},\n    \\]\n    where \\(M[i]\\) is the current “last–position” of whatever interval starts at \\(i\\) (or 0 if no interval starts at \\(i\\)).  \n    If that maximum is \\(\\le g_{\\rm old}\\), no crossing appears, and we safely update \\(M[f]=r\\).  Otherwise we stop; we have found the minimal \\(r\\) that breaks laminarity.\n\nWe maintain\n\n  • A segment‐tree (or Fenwick‐tree) **supporting**  \n    – point‐update \\(\\;M[i]\\leftarrow x\\),  \n    – range‐maximum query on \\([1..i]\\).  \n\n  • For each value \\(v\\), a **global** list of its occurrence positions in \\(a\\).  \n    We remember in two small arrays `fIdx[v]` and `hIdx[v]` the _indices_ within that list that bracket the first and last occurrence **currently** in the window.  \n    Whenever we slide the window right (increment \\(r\\)) or slide it left (increment \\(\\ell\\)), we in \\(O(1)\\) adjust those two indices and do at most two segment‐tree updates to keep \\(M[f_v]=g_v\\).\n\nBecause each of \\(\\ell\\) and \\(r\\) moves forward at most \\(n\\) times, and each move does \\(O(\\log n)\\) work in the segment‐tree, the total is \\(O(n\\log n)\\).  Finally, after we record for each \\(\\ell\\) the _first_ bad \\(r\\) in an array `R[ℓ]`, each query \\((\\ell,r)\\) is answered by checking\n\n   “Is \\(r < R[\\ell]\\) ?”\n\n– if yes, the subarray is laminar & deletable, else no.\n\nBelow is a single, self‐contained Java solution.\n\n```java\nimport java.io.*;\nimport java.util.*;\n\npublic class Main {\n    // A standard segment‐tree for point‐update and range‐max query on [1..n].\n    static class SegTree {\n        int n;\n        int[] st;\n        SegTree(int _n) {\n            n = 1;\n            while (n < _n) n <<= 1;\n            st = new int[2*n];\n        }\n        // set position i (1-based) to value v\n        void update(int i, int v) {\n            i = i + n - 1;\n            st[i] = v;\n            for (i >>= 1;

We treat each value \\(v\\) in the window as contributing an interval \\([f_v,g_v]\\).  \n2.  A subarray is orangutan‐approved exactly when no two such intervals *cross* (i.e.\\ are not laminar).  \n3.  We do a two-pointer sweep on \\(\\ell\\) and \\(r\\) so that the window \\([\\ell..r-1]\\) **is** laminar, and we try to extend it to \\([\\ell..r]\\).  \n4.  Extending the interval for the newly inserted value \\(v\\) from \\([f,g_{\\rm old}]\\) to \\([f,r]\\) can only violate laminarity if  \n       there is some other interval \\([f_u,g_u]\\) with \\(f_u<f\\) and \\(g_u>g_{\\rm old}\\).  \n5.  We maintain a segment tree `seg` on positions \\(1..n\\), where at each leaf `i` we store the current “end” \\(g_v\\) of the interval whose start is \\(i\\) (or 0 if no interval starts at \\(i\\)).  Then  \n       max on \\[1..f−1\\]  >  old g  \n   exactly signals a crossing.  \n6.  We keep each value \\(v\\)’s first–and–last occurrence in the window by indexing into the **global** list of all occurrences of \\(v\\).  Sliding the window in or out causes at most two point‐updates in the segment tree.  \n7.  Overall the pointers \\(\\ell\\) and \\(r\\) each move forward at most \\(n\\) times, each step costs \\(O(\\log n)\\) for segment‐tree operations.  Thus \\(O(n\\log n)\\) for each test, plus \\(O(1)\\) per query.  \n\nThis easily runs under the typical \\(2\\cdot10^5\\)–size and 3 s time limit."
