D. Turtle and Multiplication
time limit per test3 seconds
memory limit per test512 megabytes
Turtle just learned how to multiply two integers in his math class, and he was very excited.

Then Piggy gave him an integer n
, and asked him to construct a sequence a1,a2,…,an
 consisting of integers which satisfied the following conditions:

For all 1≤i≤n
, 1≤ai≤3⋅105
.
For all 1≤i<j≤n−1
, ai⋅ai+1≠aj⋅aj+1
.
Of all such sequences, Piggy asked Turtle to find the one with the minimum number of distinct elements.

Turtle definitely could not solve the problem, so please help him!

Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t
 (1≤t≤104
). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n
 (2≤n≤106
) — the length of the sequence a
.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n
 over all test cases does not exceed 106
.

Output
For each test case, output n
 integers a1,a2,…,an
 — the elements of the sequence a
.

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

Note
In the third test case, a=[3,4,2,6]
 violates the second condition since a1⋅a2=a3⋅a4
. a=[2,3,4,4]
 satisfy the conditions but its number of distinct elements isn't minimum.
