Novice's Mistake\n\ntime limit per test3 seconds\n\nmemory limit per test256 megabytes\n\nOne of the first programming problems by K1o0n looked like this: \"Noobish_Monk has n\n\n (1≤n≤100)\n\n friends. Each of them gave him a\n\n (1≤a≤10000)\n\n apples for his birthday. Delighted with such a gift, Noobish_Monk returned b\n\n (1≤b≤min(10000,a⋅n))\n\n apples to his friends. How many apples are left with Noobish_Monk?\"\n\n\n\nK1o0n wrote a solution, but accidentally considered the value of n\n\n as a string, so the value of n⋅a−b\n\n was calculated differently. Specifically:\n\n\n\nwhen multiplying the string n\n\n by the integer a\n\n, he will get the string s=n+n+⋯+n+na times\n\nwhen subtracting the integer b\n\n from the string s\n\n, the last b\n\n characters will be removed from it. If b\n\n is greater than or equal to the length of the string s\n\n, it will become empty.\n\nLearning about this, ErnKor became interested in how many pairs (a,b)\n\n exist for a given n\n\n, satisfying the constraints of the problem, on which K1o0n's solution gives the correct answer.\n\n\n\n\"The solution gives the correct answer\" means that it outputs a non-empty string, and this string, when converted to an integer, equals the correct answer, i.e., the value of n⋅a−b\n\n.\n\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t\n\n (1≤t≤100\n\n)  — the number of test cases.\n\n\n\nFor each test case, a single line of input contains an integer n\n\n (1≤n≤100\n\n).\n\n\n\nIt is guaranteed that in all test cases, n\n\n is distinct.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output the answer in the following format:\n\n\n\nIn the first line, output the integer x\n\n — the number of bad tests for the given n\n\n.\n\n\n\nIn the next x\n\n lines, output two integers ai\n\n and bi\n\n — such integers that K1o0n's solution on the test \"n\n\n ai\n\n bi\n\n\" gives the correct answer.\n\n\n\nExample\n\nInputCopy\n\n3\n\n2\n\n3\n\n10\n\nOutputCopy\n\n3\n\n20 18 \n\n219 216 \n\n2218 2214 \n\n1\n\n165 162 \n\n1\n\n1262 2519 \n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, a=20\n\n, b=18\n\n are suitable, as \"2\n\n\" ⋅20−18=\n\n \"22222222222222222222\n\n\"−18=22=2⋅20−18\n\n---\n\nYou are a competitive programming assistant solving Codeforces problems using Java. First, carefully read and restate the problem in your own words to ensure full understanding. Identify the input and output formats, list the constraints, and consider any edge cases that might affect the logic. Next, determine which algorithmic pattern the problem fits best—such as greedy, binary search, two pointers, dynamic programming, or graph traversal—and briefly explain why that pattern applies. Then, plan your solution step by step, describing the key ideas, data structures, or mathematical insights you’ll use. Once your plan is clear, write a clean and fully working Java program. Use import java.util.*; and include a Main class with a main method, using Scanner or BufferedReader for input depending on the constraints. Add comments to explain important logic in the code. After coding, walk through a sample input manually to show how your solution works in practice. Finally, analyze the time and space complexity of your approach using Big-O notation, justifying your answer. Think step by step and only write code once the logic is sound and complete."
