One fine evening, Alice sat down to play the classic game "Connect the Dots", but with a twist.

To play the game, Alice draws a straight line and marks n
 points on it, indexed from 1
 to n
. Initially, there are no arcs between the points, so they are all disjoint. After that, Alice performs m
 operations of the following type:

She picks three integers ai
, di
 (1≤di≤10
), and ki
.
She selects points ai,ai+di,ai+2di,ai+3di,…,ai+ki⋅di
 and connects each pair of these points with arcs.
After performing all m
 operations, she wants to know the number of connected components†
 these points form. Please help her find this number.

†
 Two points are said to be in one connected component if there is a path between them via several (possibly zero) arcs and other points.

Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t
 (1≤t≤105
). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n
 and m
 (1≤n≤2⋅105
, 1≤m≤2⋅105
).

The i
-th of the following m
 lines contains three integers ai
, di
, and ki
 (1≤ai≤ai+ki⋅di≤n
, 1≤di≤10
, 0≤ki≤n
).

It is guaranteed that both the sum of n
 and the sum of m
 over all test cases do not exceed 2⋅105
.

Output
For each test case, output the number of connected components.

Note
In the first test case, there are n=10
 points. The first operation joins the points 1
, 3
, 5
, 7
, and 9
. The second operation joins the points 2
, 4
, 6
, 8
, and 10
. There are thus two connected components: {1,3,5,7,9}
 and {2,4,6,8,10}
.

In the second test case, there are n=100
 points. The only operation joins the points 19
, 21
, 23
, 25
, and 27
. Now all of them form a single connected component of size 5
. The other 95
 points form single-point connected components. Thus, the answer is 1+95=96
.

In the third test case, there are n=100
 points. After the operations, all odd points from 1
 to 79
 will be in one connected component of size 40
. The other 60
 points form single-point connected components. Thus, the answer is 1+60=61
.
