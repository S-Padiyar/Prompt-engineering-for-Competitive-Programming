The Omnipotent Monster Killer\n\ntime limit per test3 seconds\n\nmemory limit per test512 megabytes\n\nYou, the monster killer, want to kill a group of monsters. The monsters are on a tree with n\n\n vertices. On vertex with number i\n\n (1≤i≤n\n\n), there is a monster with ai\n\n attack points. You want to battle with monsters for 10100\n\n rounds.\n\n\n\nIn each round, the following happens in order:\n\n\n\nAll living monsters attack you. Your health decreases by the sum of attack points of all living monsters.\n\nYou select some (possibly all or none) monsters and kill them. After being killed, the monster will not be able to do any attacks in the future.\n\nThere is a restriction: in one round, you cannot kill two monsters that are directly connected by an edge.\n\n\n\nIf you choose what monsters to attack optimally, what is the smallest health decrement you can have after all rounds?\n\n\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t\n\n (1≤t≤104\n\n). Description of the test cases follows.\n\n\n\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer n\n\n (1≤n≤3⋅105\n\n).\n\n\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n\n\n integers a1,…,an\n\n (1≤ai≤1012\n\n).\n\n\n\nThe following n−1\n\n lines each contain two integers x,y\n\n (1≤x,y≤n\n\n), denoting an edge on the tree connecting vertex x\n\n and y\n\n.\n\n\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n\n\n over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅105\n\n.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print one integer: the minimum possible health decrement.\n\n\n\nExample\n\nInputCopy\n\n3\n\n1\n\n1000000000000\n\n5\n\n47 15 32 29 23\n\n1 2\n\n1 3\n\n2 4\n\n2 5\n\n7\n\n8 10 2 3 5 7 4\n\n1 2\n\n1 4\n\n3 2\n\n5 3\n\n6 2\n\n7 5\n\nOutputCopy\n\n1000000000000\n\n193\n\n57\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, an optimal sequence of operations would be:\n\n\n\nIn the first round: first, receive the attack from the monster on vertex 1\n\n, so your health decreases by 1012\n\n.

First, carefully read and restate the problem in your own words to ensure full understanding. Identify the input and output formats, list the constraints, and consider any edge cases that might affect the logic. Next, determine which algorithmic pattern the problem fits best—such as greedy, binary search, two pointers, dynamic programming, or graph traversal—and briefly explain why that pattern applies. Then, plan your solution step by step, describing the key ideas, data structures, or mathematical insights you’ll use. Once your plan is clear, write a clean and fully working Java program. Use import java.util.*; and include a Main class with a main method, using Scanner or BufferedReader for input depending on the constraints. Add comments to explain important logic in the code. After coding, walk through a sample input manually to show how your solution works in practice. Finally, analyze the time and space complexity of your approach using Big-O notation, justifying your answer. Think step by step and only write code once the logic is sound and complete."

We fight for “infinitely many” rounds (effectively until all monsters are dead). In each round:\\n\\n1. All *currently living* monsters deal damage equal to the sum of their attack powers.\\n2. We may kill any subset of living monsters, subject to the restriction that we cannot kill two monsters that are directly connected by an edge in the same round.\\n\\nOnce killed, a monster never attacks again. We want to schedule our kills so that the *total* damage taken (summed over all rounds) is minimized.\\n\\nBecause killing in later rounds means those monsters inflict more rounds of damage on us, each monster \\\\(v\\\\) with attack power \\\\(a_v\\\\) contributes\\n\\\\[\\n   a_v \\\\times (\\\\text{the round in which we kill }v)\\n\\\\]\\nto the total damage.  Our task is to assign each vertex \\\\(v\\\\) an integer “kill round” \\\\(k_v\\\\ge1\\\\) so that:\\n\\n- If \\\\((u,v)\\\\) is an edge, then \\\\(k_u \\\\ne k_v\\\\) (we cannot kill both ends of an edge in the same round).\\n- We minimize \\\\(\\\\sum_v a_v\\\\cdot k_v\\\\).\\n\\nKey Observation  \\nA tree is bipartite.  We can 2-color its vertices (say colors 0 and 1) so that no edge has both ends in the same color class.  That coloring exactly matches the “independent‐set” constraint for each round if we use at most two rounds:  \\n- In round 1 kill *all* vertices of color 0.  \\n- In round 2 kill *all* vertices of color 1.  \\n\\nNo edge has both ends in color 0 or both in color 1, so each color‐class is an independent set.  \\nThus every monster is dead by the end of round 2.  No benefit can come from using more than 2 rounds (because that would only increase the multipliers for all \\\\(a_v\\\\)).  \\n\\nLet  \\n\\\\[\\n  S_0 = \\\\sum_{\\\\text{vertices }v\\\\text{ with color }0} a_v,\\\\quad\\n  S_1 = \\\\sum_{\\\\text{vertices }v\\\\text{ with color }1} a_v.\\n\\\\]\\nIf we kill color‐0 in round 1 and color‐1 in round 2, the total damage is\\n\\\\[\\n   S_0\\\\cdot1 \\\\;+\\\\; S_1\\\\cdot2 \\\\;=\\\\; S_0 + 2\\\\,S_1.\\n\\\\]\\nIf we swap (kill color-1 first), total damage is\\n\\\\[\\n   S_1\\\\cdot1 \\\\;+\\\\; S_0\\\\cdot2 \\\\;=\\\\; S_1 + 2\\\\,S_0.\\n\\\\]\\nWe take the minimum of these two options.\\n\\nAlgorithmic Steps  \\n1. Read \\\\(t\\\\), the number of test cases.  \\n2. For each test case:\\n   - Read \\\\(n\\\\).  \\n   - Read the array \\\\(a[1\\\\ldots n]\\\\).  \\n   - Build the adjacency list of the tree.  \\n   - Do a BFS (or DFS) from node 1 to 2-color the tree; track `color[v]` = 0 or 1.  \\n   - Accumulate `sum0` = total \\\\(a[v]\\\\) over vertices of color 0, and `sum1` for color 1.  \\n   - Compute `option1 = sum0 + 2*sum1` and `option2 = 2*sum0 + sum1`.  \\n   - Answer = `min(option1, option2)`.  \\n3. Print the answer for each test.\\n\\nComplexities  \\n- Time per test:  \\n  - Building the adjacency list: \\\\(O(n)\\\\).  \\n  - BFS + summation: \\\\(O(n)\\\\).  \\n  Overall \\\\(O(n)\\\\).  \\n- Over all tests the sum of \\\\(n\\\\) is up to \\\\(3\\\\times10^5\\\\), so total time is \\\\(O(\\\\sum n)\\\\).  \\n- Space: \\\\(O(n)\\\\) for storing the graph, colors, and sums.\\n\\nJava Implementation  \\n\\n```java\\nimport java.io.*;\\nimport java.util.*;\\n\\npublic class Main {\\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\\n        // Use BufferedReader/PrintWriter for fast I/O\\n        BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));\\n        PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(System.out);\\n        \\n        int t = Integer.parseInt(in.readLine().trim());\\n        while (t-- > 0) {\\n            int n = Integer.parseInt(in.readLine().trim());\\n            \\n            // Read attack powers\\n            long[] a = new long[n + 1];\\n            StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(in.readLine());\\n            for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\\n                a[i] = Long.parseLong(st.nextToken());\\n            }\\n            \\n            // Build the tree\\n            List<Integer>[] adj = new ArrayList[n + 1];\\n            for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\\n                adj[i] = new ArrayList<>();\\n            }\\n            for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {\\n                st = new StringTokenizer(in.readLine());\\n                int u = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\\n                int v = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\\n                adj[u].add(v);\\n                adj[v].add(u);\\n            }\\n            \\n            // BFS to 2-color the tree\\n            int[] color = new int[n + 1];\\n            Arrays.fill(color, -1);\\n            long sum0 = 0, sum1 = 0;\\n            \\n            Deque<Integer> queue = new ArrayDeque<>();\\n            queue.add(1);\\n            color[1] = 0;\\n            \\n            while (!queue.isEmpty()) {\\n                int u = queue.poll();\\n                if (color[u] == 0) {\\n                    sum0 += a[u];\\n                } else {\\n                    sum1 += a[u];\\n                }\\n                for (int v : adj[u]) {\\n                    if (color[v] == -1) {\\n                        color[v] = color[u] ^ 1;  // alternate color 0<->1\\n                        queue.add(v);\\n                    }\\n                }\\n            }\\n            \\n            // Two options: kill color0 in round1 or color1 in round1\\n            long option1 = sum0 + 2 * sum1;  // color0 first, color1 second\\n            long option2 = 2 * sum0 + sum1;  // color1 first, color0 second\\n            long ans = Math.min(option1, option2);\\n            \\n            out.println(ans);\\n        }\\n        \\n        out.flush();\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nExplanation of Key Parts  \\n- We only need two rounds because the tree is bipartite (no odd cycles), so two colors suffice to make each color class an independent set.  \\n- Killing a monster in round \\\\(k\\\\) lets it attack us \\\\(k\\\\) times.
