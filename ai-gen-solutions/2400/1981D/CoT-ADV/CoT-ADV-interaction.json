First, carefully read and restate the problem in your own words to ensure full understanding. Identify the input and output formats, list the constraints, and consider any edge cases that might affect the logic. Next, determine which algorithmic pattern the problem fits best—such as greedy, binary search, two pointers, dynamic programming, or graph traversal—and briefly explain why that pattern applies. Then, plan your solution step by step, describing the key ideas, data structures, or mathematical insights you’ll use. Once your plan is clear, write a clean and fully working Java program. Use import java.util.*; and include a Main class with a main method, using Scanner or BufferedReader for input depending on the constraints. Add comments to explain important logic in the code. After coding, walk through a sample input manually to show how your solution works in practice. Finally, analyze the time and space complexity of your approach using Big-O notation, justifying your answer. Think step by step and only write code once the logic is sound and complete."

All adjacent products \\\\(a_i\\\\cdot a_{i+1}\\\\) \\\\((1\\\\le i\\\\le n-1)\\\\) are pairwise distinct.\\n2. We use the minimum possible number of distinct values in the entire sequence.\\n\\nOutput any valid sequence for each test.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Key Observations**\\n\\n1.  If our sequence uses exactly \\\\(k\\\\) distinct values (labeled \\\\(1,2,\\\\dots,k\\\\)), then there are\\n   \\\\[\\n     \\\\underbrace{k}_{\\\\text{loops }(i,i)} + \\\\underbrace{\\\\binom{k}{2}}_{\\\\text{unordered pairs }(i<j)} \\n     \\\\;=\\\\;\\\\frac{k(k+1)}{2}\\n   \\\\]\\n   possible *unordered* pairs \\\\(\\\\{i,j\\\\}\\\\).  Since the product \\\\(i\\\\cdot j\\\\) does not care about order, each unordered pair yields one possible product.\\n2.  We need \\\\(n-1\\\\) distinct adjacent products, i.e.\\\\ \\\\(n-1\\\\) distinct unordered pairs in our sequence of adjacent steps.  Hence we must choose \\\\(k\\\\) so that\\n   \\\\[\\n     \\\\frac{k(k+1)}{2}\\\\;\\\\ge\\\\;n-1.\\n   \\\\]\\n   Call \\\\(m = n-1\\\\).\\n3.  It turns out that if \\\\(\\\\tfrac{k(k+1)}{2}=m\\\\) *and* \\\\(k\\\\) is even, the underlying graph with loops has *all* vertices of odd degree, so there is no single trail that uses *all* edges exactly once.  But we *can* afford to use *more* edges than needed; that is, we can safely bump \\\\(k\\\\) by one in that bad even-\\\\(k\\\\) case so that we have strictly more than \\\\(m\\\\) edges available (and then a trail of length \\\\(m\\\\) always exists).\\n4.  Once \\\\(k\\\\) is chosen, we build a walk of length \\\\(n\\\\) (i.e.\\\\ \\\\(n-1\\\\) edges) in the complete graph on \\\\(\\\\{1,\\\\dots,k\\\\}\\\\) *with loops*, taking care never to repeat an edge.  This ensures each adjacent unordered pair is new, hence the products are distinct.\\n5.  A simple *greedy* suffices: start at node 1, and at each step, from the current node `cur` pick the smallest neighbor `nxt` (including a loop if unused) for which the edge \\\\(\\\\{cur,nxt\\\\}\\\\) has not yet been used.  Mark it used and move to `nxt`.  One can show that as long as we have \\\\(\\\\tfrac{k(k+1)}{2}>m\\\\) or the Euler-trail parity condition is met, this greedy never gets stuck.\\n\\nThe total distinct integers used is exactly \\\\(k\\\\), which by construction is the smallest possible (with the slight bump in the even-\\\\(k\\\\), full-edge case).\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Complexities**\\n\\n- Computing \\\\(k\\\\) from \\\\(m=n-1\\\\) is \\\\(O(1)\\\\) via a small integer correction around \\\\(\\\\sqrt{1+8m}\\\\).\\n- Building the sequence of length \\\\(n\\\\) takes \\\\(O(n + k^2)\\\\) in the worst case (we keep pointers per node and a boolean matrix of size \\\\(k\\\\times k\\\\) to mark used edges).  Since \\\\(k\\\\approx O(\\\\sqrt{n})\\\\), this is \\\\(O(n)\\\\) overall.\\n- Summed over all test cases, \\\\(\\\\sum n\\\\le 10^6\\\\), so it runs comfortably in time.\\n\\n---\\n\\n```java\\nimport java.io.*;\\nimport java.util.*;\\n\\npublic class Main {\\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\\n        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));\\n        BufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(System.out));\\n        int t = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine().trim());\\n        \\n        // We will reuse a single 'used' matrix up to max k ~ 1415\\n        final int MAXK = 1500;\\n        boolean[][] used = new boolean[MAXK+1][MAXK+1];\\n        int[] ptr = new int[MAXK+1];  // for each node, next candidate neighbor\\n        \\n        while (t-- > 0) {\\n            int n = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine().trim());\\n            int m = n - 1;  // we need m distinct adjacent pairs\\n            \\n            // 1) find smallest k so that k*(k+1)/2 >= m\\n            //    then if equality holds and k is even, bump k by 1\\n            int k = (int)Math.floor((Math.sqrt(1 + 8L*m) - 1)/2);\\n            while ((long)k*(k+1)/2 < m) k++;\\n            long totalEdges = (long)k*(k+1)/2;\\n            if (totalEdges == m && k % 2 == 0) {\\n                // avoid the parity trap where no Euler trail covers exactly all edges\\n                k++;\\n                totalEdges = (long)k*(k+1)/2;\\n            }\\n            \\n            // 2) clear 'used' for nodes 1..k and reset pointers\\n            for (int i = 1; i <= k; i++) {\\n                ptr[i] = 1;\\n                Arrays.fill(used[i], 1, k+1, false);\\n            }\\n            \\n            // 3) build the walk/sequence\\n            int[] a = new int[n];\\n            a[0] = 1;        // start at node 1\\n            int cur = 1;\\n            \\n            for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\\n                // advance ptr[cur] until we find an unused edge {cur, ptr[cur]}\\n                while (ptr[cur] <= k && used[cur][ptr[cur]]) {\\n                    ptr[cur]++;\\n                }\\n                // ptr[cur] must be <= k because we arranged totalEdges > (n-1) or parity is OK\\n                int nxt = ptr[cur];\\n                // mark undirected edge used\\n                used[cur][nxt] = true;\\n                used[nxt][cur] = true;\\n                a[i] = nxt;\\n                cur = nxt;\\n            }\\n            \\n            // 4) output the sequence\\n            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\\n                bw.write(a[i] + (i+1<n ? \\\" \\\" : \\\"\\\\n\\\"));\\n            }\\n        }\\n        \\n        bw.flush();\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Explanation of Core Steps**\\n\\n1. **Choosing \\\\(k\\\\):**  \\n   We need at least \\\\(n-1\\\\) distinct unordered pairs.  A pool of \\\\(k\\\\) values yields \\\\(\\\\tfrac{k(k+1)}{2}\\\\) pairs (including loops).  Solve\\n   \\\\[\\n     \\\\frac{k(k+1)}{2} \\\\;\\\\ge\\\\; n-1\\n   \\\\]\\n   by the quadratic formula and a small integer adjustment.  If equality holds and \\\\(k\\\\) is even, we bump \\\\(k\\\\) by one to avoid the situation in which every vertex has odd degree: that graph would *not* admit a single trail covering all edges exactly once, making a greedy selection potentially get stuck.  By bumping we ensure \\\\(\\\\tfrac{k(k+1)}{2} > n-1\\\\), so we have \\\"slack\\\" and never exhaust all edges around our current vertex prematurely.\\n\\n2. **Greedy walk construction:**  \\n   - We maintain a boolean matrix `used[i][j]` to know if the unordered pair \\\\(\\\\{i,j\\\\}\\\\) was already taken as an adjacent step.  \\n   - For each node `i` we keep a pointer `ptr[i]` initially 1, meaning the next neighbor candidate is 1.  \\n   - Starting from `cur = 1`, at each new position we scan `ptr[cur]` forward until we find an index `nxt` with `used[cur][nxt] == false`.  We then mark `used[cur][nxt] = used[nxt][cur] = true` and move `cur = nxt`.  \\n   - This guarantees we never repeat an unordered pair, hence all products are distinct.\\n\\n3. **Complexity analysis:**  \\n   - Determining \\\\(k\\\\) is \\\\(O(1)\\\\).  \\n   - We reset a \\\\(k\\\\times k\\\\) boolean matrix in \\\\(O(k^2)\\\\).  Since \\\\(k\\\\approx O(\\\\sqrt{n})\\\\), that is \\\\(O(n)\\\\) in total across all test cases (sum of \\\\(n\\\\le 10^6\\\\)).  \\n   - Building the walk of length \\\\(n\\\\) is \\\\(O(n + k^2)\\\\) in the worst case.  Overall linear in the total input size.\\n\\nThis design uses the minimum number \\\\(k\\\\) of distinct values, satisfying the problem requirement.\",\n        \"refusal\": null,\n        \"role\": \"assistant\",\n        \"annotations\": [],\n        \"audio\": null,\n        \"function_call\": null,\n        \"tool_calls\": null\n      },\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"protected_material_code\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": true,\n          \"citation\": {\n            \"URL\": \"https://github.com/JaeHyeonKim19/jaehyeonkim19.github.io/tree/00c0df0b55a6187b71395b6a37e1e0af6013c06b/posts%2Fcodingtest%2Fcodeup-3701-pascal-triangle%2Fcodeup-3701-pascal-triangle.md\",\n            \"license\": \"NOASSERTION\"\n          }\n        },\n        \"protected_material_text\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"created\": 1753326885,\n  \"model\": \"o4-mini-2025-04-16\",\n  \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n  \"service_tier\": null,\n  \"system_fingerprint\": null,\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"completion_tokens\": 8759,\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 614,\n    \"total_tokens\": 9373,\n    \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n      \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"reasoning_tokens\": 6784,\n      \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n    },\n    \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"cached_tokens\": 0\n    }\n  },\n  \"prompt_filter_results\": [\n    {\n      \"prompt_index\": 0,\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"jailbreak\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
