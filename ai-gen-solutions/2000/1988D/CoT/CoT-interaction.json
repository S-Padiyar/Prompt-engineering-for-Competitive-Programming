The Omnipotent Monster Killer\n\ntime limit per test3 seconds\n\nmemory limit per test512 megabytes\n\nYou, the monster killer, want to kill a group of monsters. The monsters are on a tree with n\n\n vertices. On vertex with number i\n\n (1≤i≤n\n\n), there is a monster with ai\n\n attack points. You want to battle with monsters for 10100\n\n rounds.\n\n\n\nIn each round, the following happens in order:\n\n\n\nAll living monsters attack you. Your health decreases by the sum of attack points of all living monsters.\n\nYou select some (possibly all or none) monsters and kill them. After being killed, the monster will not be able to do any attacks in the future.\n\nThere is a restriction: in one round, you cannot kill two monsters that are directly connected by an edge.\n\n\n\nIf you choose what monsters to attack optimally, what is the smallest health decrement you can have after all rounds?\n\n\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t\n\n (1≤t≤104\n\n). Description of the test cases follows.\n\n\n\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer n\n\n (1≤n≤3⋅105\n\n).\n\n\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n\n\n integers a1,…,an\n\n (1≤ai≤1012\n\n).\n\n\n\nThe following n−1\n\n lines each contain two integers x,y\n\n (1≤x,y≤n\n\n), denoting an edge on the tree connecting vertex x\n\n and y\n\n.\n\n\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n\n\n over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅105\n\n.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print one integer: the minimum possible health decrement.\n\n\n\nExample\n\nInputCopy\n\n3\n\n1\n\n1000000000000\n\n5\n\n47 15 32 29 23\n\n1 2\n\n1 3\n\n2 4\n\n2 5\n\n7\n\n8 10 2 3 5 7 4\n\n1 2\n\n1 4\n\n3 2\n\n5 3\n\n6 2\n\n7 5\n\nOutputCopy\n\n1000000000000\n\n193\n\n57\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, an optimal sequence of operations would be:\n\n\n\nIn the first round: first, receive the attack from the monster on vertex 1\n\n, so your health decreases by 1012\n\n.

Then kill the monsters on vertex 1,4,5\n\n.\n\nIn the second round: first, receive the attack from the monster on vertex 2,3\n\n, so your health decreases by 15+32=47\n\n. Then kill the monsters on vertex 2,3\n\n.\n\nIn the third round to the 10100\n\n-th round: all monsters have been killed, so nothing happens.\n\nThe total health decrement is 193\n\n.\n\n\n\nIn the third test case, an optimal sequence of operations would be:\n\n\n\nIn the first round: first, receive the attack from the monster on vertex 1,2,3,4,5,6,7\n\n, so your health decreases by 8+10+2+3+5+7+4=39\n\n. Then kill the monsters on vertex 1,3,6,7\n\n.\n\nIn the second round: first, receive the attack from the monster on vertex 2,4,5\n\n, so your health decreases by 10+3+5=18\n\n.

We wish to schedule the killing of all monsters in “rounds.”  In each round:\\n\\n1.  All *currently alive* monsters deal us damage equal to the sum of their \\\\(a_i\\\\).\\n2.  We choose an independent set of the still–alive monsters (no two adjacent in the tree) and kill them.  Those die immediately and will no longer deal damage in any subsequent round.\\n\\nWe have effectively an unbounded number of rounds (up to \\\\(10^{100}\\\\)), but after we kill everybody, no further damage happens.  Our goal is to minimize the **total** damage taken, which is\\n\\\\[\\n   \\\\sum_{\\\\text{round } k}\\n       \\\\Bigl(\\\\sum_{v\\\\text{ alive at start of round }k} a_v\\\\Bigr).\\n\\\\]\\n\\nA key re‐interpretation is that if we assign to vertex \\\\(v\\\\) the integer round \\\\(r_v\\\\) in which it is killed, it contributes \\\\(a_v\\\\) damage in rounds \\\\(1,2,\\\\dots,r_v\\\\).  Hence the total damage is\\n\\n\\\\[\\n   \\\\sum_{v=1}^n a_v\\\\;r_v.\\n\\\\]\\n\\nThe only constraint on the \\\\(r_v\\\\) is that adjacent vertices must have *different* \\\\(r\\\\)-values (since we cannot kill two adjacent monsters in the same round).\\n\\nBecause the tree is bipartite, we may 2‐color its vertices (say “color 0” and “color 1”); each color‐class is an independent set.  Thus it is legal to pick one color class to kill in round 1 and the other in round 2.  No third (or higher) round can *reduce* the total weighted sum \\\\(\\\\sum a_vr_v\\\\).  Indeed, if you tried to spread out kills over 3 or more rounds, you would only force some \\\\(r_v\\\\ge3\\\\), which can only *increase* \\\\(a_vr_v\\\\) relative to putting everything into two buckets.\\n\\nHence the optimal strategy is:\\n\\n1.  Label the tree with a standard 2‐coloring (any root and assign alternating 0/1 by BFS or DFS).\\n2.  Let\\n   \\\\[\\n     S_0 = \\\\sum_{v: \\\\text{color}(v)=0} a_v,\\\\quad\\n     S_1 = \\\\sum_{v: \\\\text{color}(v)=1} a_v.\\n   \\\\]\\n3.  We kill *all* vertices of one color in round 1, and *all* of the other color in round 2.  \\n   -  If we kill color‐0 in round 1 and color‐1 in round 2, the total damage is\\n      \\\\(\\\\sum a_v\\\\cdot1\\\\;+\\\\;\\\\sum_{v:\\\\mathrm{color}=1}a_v\\\\cdot1\\n       = (S_0+S_1)+S_1.\\\\)\\n   -  If we reverse the order, the total damage is \\\\((S_0+S_1)+S_0.\\\\)\\n\\n   We pick the smaller of these two, i.e.\\n   \\\\[\\n     \\\\min\\\\bigl((S_0+S_1)+S_1,\\\\;(S_0+S_1)+S_0\\\\bigr)\\n     = (S_0+S_1)\\\\;+\\\\;\\\\min(S_0,S_1).\\n   \\\\]\\n\\nThus the answer is\\n\\\\[\\n  \\\\text{totalDamage} \\\\;=\\\\; \\\\underbrace{\\\\sum_{v=1}^n a_v}_{S_0+S_1}\\n                      \\\\;+\\\\;\\\\min\\\\bigl(S_0,\\\\,S_1\\\\bigr).\\n\\\\]\\n\\nWe implement this in \\\\(O(n)\\\\) per test case by\\n\\n- Reading the tree and the array \\\\(a\\\\).\\n- Building an adjacency list.\\n- Running a BFS (or DFS) from node 1 to 2‐color the tree and accumulate\\n  \\\\(\\\\;S_0=\\\\sum_{v\\\\,:\\\\,\\\\mathrm{color}=0} a_v,\\\\;S_1=\\\\sum_{v\\\\,:\\\\,\\\\mathrm{color}=1} a_v.\\\\)\\n- Printing \\\\((S_0+S_1)+\\\\min(S_0,S_1)\\\\).\\n\\nSince \\\\(\\\\sum n \\\\le 3\\\\times10^5\\\\) over all test cases, this runs comfortably in time.\\n\\n---\\n\\n```java\\nimport java.io.*;\\nimport java.util.*;\\n\\npublic class Main {\\n    static class FastInput {\\n        BufferedReader br;\\n        StringTokenizer st;\\n        FastInput(InputStream in) {\\n            br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(in));\\n        }\\n        String nextToken() throws IOException {\\n            while (st == null || !st.hasMoreTokens()) {\\n                String line = br.readLine();\\n                if (line == null) return null;\\n                st = new StringTokenizer(line);\\n            }\\n            return st.nextToken();\\n        }\\n        int nextInt() throws IOException {\\n            return Integer.parseInt(nextToken());\\n        }\\n        long nextLong() throws IOException {\\n            return Long.parseLong(nextToken());\\n        }\\n    }\\n    \\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\\n        FastInput in = new FastInput(System.in);\\n        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\\n        \\n        int t = in.nextInt();\\n        while (t-- > 0) {\\n            int n = in.nextInt();\\n            long[] a = new long[n+1];\\n            for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\\n                a[i] = in.nextLong();\\n            }\\n            \\n            // Build adjacency list for the tree\\n            List<Integer>[] adj = new ArrayList[n+1];\\n            for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\\n                adj[i] = new ArrayList<>();\\n            }\\n            for (int i = 0; i < n-1; i++) {\\n                int x = in.nextInt();\\n                int y = in.nextInt();\\n                adj[x].add(y);\\n                adj[y].add(x);\\n            }\\n            \\n            // BFS to 2-color the tree, accumulate sum0 and sum1\\n            long sum0 = 0, sum1 = 0;\\n            int[] color = new int[n+1];\\n            Arrays.fill(color, -1);\\n            \\n            Deque<Integer> queue = new ArrayDeque<>();\\n            queue.add(1);\\n            color[1] = 0;\\n            \\n            while (!queue.isEmpty()) {\\n                int u = queue.poll();\\n                if (color[u] == 0) sum0 += a[u];\\n                else             sum1 += a[u];\\n                \\n                for (int v : adj[u]) {\\n                    if (color[v] == -1) {\\n                        color[v] = 1 - color[u];\\n                        queue.add(v);\\n                    }\\n                }\\n            }\\n            \\n            long total = sum0 + sum1;\\n            long ans = total + Math.min(sum0, sum1);\\n            sb.append(ans).append('\\\\n');\\n        }\\n        \\n        System.out.print(sb);\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Explanation of Key Steps**\\n\\n1. **Bipartition of a Tree**  \\n   Any tree is bipartite.
