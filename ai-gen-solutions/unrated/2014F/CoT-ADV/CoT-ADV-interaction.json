Sheriff's Defense\n\ntime limit per test2 seconds\n\nmemory limit per test256 megabytes\n\n\"Why, master,\" quoth Little John, taking the bags and weighing them in his hand, \"here is the chink of gold.\"\n\nThe folk hero Robin Hood has been troubling Sheriff of Nottingham greatly. Sheriff knows that Robin Hood is about to attack his camps and he wants to be prepared.\n\n\n\nSheriff of Nottingham built the camps with strategy in mind and thus there are exactly n\n\n camps numbered from 1\n\n to n\n\n and n−1\n\n trails, each connecting two camps. Any camp can be reached from any other camp. Each camp i\n\n has initially ai\n\n gold.\n\n\n\nAs it is now, all camps would be destroyed by Robin. Sheriff can strengthen a camp by subtracting exactly c\n\n gold from each of its neighboring camps and use it to build better defenses for that camp. Strengthening a camp doesn't change its gold, only its neighbors' gold. A camp can have negative gold.\n\n\n\nAfter Robin Hood's attack, all camps that have been strengthened survive the attack, all others are destroyed.\n\n\n\nWhat's the maximum gold Sheriff can keep in his surviving camps after Robin Hood's attack if he strengthens his camps optimally?\n\n\n\nCamp a\n\n is neighboring camp b\n\n if and only if there exists a trail connecting a\n\n and b\n\n. Only strengthened camps count towards the answer, as others are destroyed.\n\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t\n\n (1≤t≤104\n\n) — the number of test cases.\n\n\n\nEach test case begins with two integers n\n\n, c\n\n (1≤n≤2⋅105,1≤c≤109\n\n) — the number of camps and the gold taken from each neighboring camp for strengthening.\n\n\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n\n\n integers a1,a2,…,an\n\n (−109≤ai≤109\n\n) — the initial gold of each camp.\n\n\n\nThen follow n−1\n\n lines, each with integers u\n\n, v\n\n (1≤u,v≤n\n\n, u≠v\n\n) — meaning that there is a trail between u\n\n and v\n\n.\n\n\n\nThe sum of n\n\n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2⋅105\n\n.\n\n\n\nIt is guaranteed that any camp is reachable from any other camp.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nOutput a single integer, the maximum gold Sheriff of Nottingham can keep in his surviving camps after Robin Hood's attack.\n\n\n\nExample\n\nInputCopy\n\n5\n\n3 1\n\n2 3 1\n\n1 2\n\n2 3\n\n3 1\n\n3 6 3\n\n1 2\n\n2 3\n\n3 1\n\n-2 -3 -1\n\n1 2\n\n2 3\n\n6 1\n\n5 -4 3 6 7 3\n\n4 1\n\n5 1\n\n3 5\n\n3 6\n\n1 2\n\n8 1\n\n3 5 2 7 8 5 -3 -4\n\n7 3\n\n1 8\n\n4 3\n\n3 5\n\n7 6\n\n8 7\n\n2 1\n\nOutputCopy\n\n3\n\n8\n\n0\n\n17\n\n26\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, it is optimal to strengthen the second base.

First, carefully read and restate the problem in your own words to ensure full understanding. Identify the input and output formats, list the constraints, and consider any edge cases that might affect the logic. Next, determine which algorithmic pattern the problem fits best—such as greedy, binary search, two pointers, dynamic programming, or graph traversal—and briefly explain why that pattern applies. Then, plan your solution step by step, describing the key ideas, data structures, or mathematical insights you’ll use. Once your plan is clear, write a clean and fully working Java program. Use import java.util.*; and include a Main class with a main method, using Scanner or BufferedReader for input depending on the constraints. Add comments to explain important logic in the code. After coding, walk through a sample input manually to show how your solution works in practice. Finally, analyze the time and space complexity of your approach using Big-O notation, justifying your answer. Think step by step and only write code once the logic is sound and complete."

We may “strengthen” any subset \\\\(S\\\\) of camps.  Strengthening a camp \\\\(u\\\\) does not change its own gold, but it **subtracts** \\\\(c\\\\) gold from each of its neighbors (regardless of whether those neighbors are themselves strengthened or not).  After the attack, *only* the camps in \\\\(S\\\\) survive, and each surviving camp \\\\(i\\\\)'s gold has been reduced by \\\\(c\\\\) for **each** of its neighbors in \\\\(S\\\\) who was also strengthened (because every strengthened neighbor subtracts \\\\(c\\\\) from \\\\(i\\\\)).  \\n\\nWe want to choose a subset \\\\(S\\\\subseteq\\\\{1,\\\\dots,n\\\\}\\\\) to maximize\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\sum_{i\\\\in S} \\\\bigl(a_i - c\\\\cdot(\\\\text{# of neighbors of }i\\\\text{ in }S)\\\\bigr).\\n\\\\]\\nObserve that whenever an edge \\\\((u,v)\\\\) has both ends in \\\\(S\\\\), it causes a total penalty of \\\\(2c\\\\) (one for \\\\(u\\\\) losing \\\\(c\\\\) from \\\\(v\\\\)'s strengthening, and one for \\\\(v\\\\) losing \\\\(c\\\\) from \\\\(u\\\\)'s strengthening).  If an edge has only one end in \\\\(S\\\\), it contributes no penalty to any surviving node.  If neither end is in \\\\(S\\\\), obviously it does nothing.\\n\\nSince the camps form a tree, we can solve this in \\\\(O(n)\\\\) per test by a simple tree‐DP of two states per node \\\\(u\\\\):\\n\\nDefine\\n dp0[u] = maximum total we can get from the subtree rooted at \\\\(u\\\\) if **we do not** strengthen \\\\(u\\\\),\\n dp1[u] = maximum total we can get from the subtree rooted at \\\\(u\\\\) if **we do** strengthen \\\\(u\\\\).\\n\\nTransitions (where we have made \\\\(u\\\\) the parent of all its children in a rooted tree):\\n- If we do **not** strengthen \\\\(u\\\\), then each child \\\\(v\\\\) may independently be strengthened or not, with no penalty on the edge \\\\(u\\\\!-\\\\!v\\\\).  \\n  \\\\[\\n    \\\\text{dp0}[u] \\n      = \\\\sum_{v\\\\in \\\\text{children}(u)} \\\\max\\\\bigl(\\\\text{dp0}[v],\\\\,\\\\text{dp1}[v]\\\\bigr).\\n  \\\\]\\n- If we **do** strengthen \\\\(u\\\\), we collect \\\\(a_u\\\\).

Edges with only one endpoint in \\\\(S\\\\) do not penalize any surviving node.  Hence the total for \\\\(S\\\\) is\\n   \\\\[\\n     \\\\sum_{i\\\\in S} a_i \\\\;-\\\\; 2c \\\\times \\\\bigl|\\\\{\\\\text{edges entirely inside }S\\\\}\\\\bigr|.\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n2. **Tree DP**  \\n   - `dp0[u]` = maximum total from the subtree of \\\\(u\\\\) if we do **not** pick \\\\(u\\\\).  \\n     In that case, each child \\\\(v\\\\) is free to be picked or not (we take the best of `dp0[v]` vs. `dp1[v]`), and no penalty arises on the edge \\\\((u,v)\\\\).  \\n   - `dp1[u]` = maximum total from the subtree of \\\\(u\\\\) if we **do** pick \\\\(u\\\\).  \\n     We get \\\\(a_u\\\\).  For each child \\\\(v\\\\), if we also pick \\\\(v\\\\), we must subtract \\\\(2c\\\\) to account for the edge penalty; hence from the child we get \\\\(\\\\max(\\\\text{dp0}[v],\\\\,\\\\text{dp1}[v] - 2c)\\\\).\\n\\n3. **Root at 1 and BFS‐ordering**  \\n   We do a BFS from node 1 to record each node’s parent and an ordering of the nodes so that, when we process the array in reverse, we always see children before their parent.  That lets us fill `dp0[u]`, `dp1[u]` in one pass of \\\\(O(n)\\\\).\\n\\n4. **Answer**  \\n   Finally we take \\\\(\\\\max(\\\\text{dp0}[1],\\\\;\\\\text{dp1}[1])\\\\).  It can never be worse than 0, because we could always choose no nodes at all.\\n\\nTime complexity per test:  \\n- Building the graph: \\\\(O(n)\\\\).  \\n- BFS + DP (one pass over edges): \\\\(O(n)\\\\).  \\n\\nOverall, since the sum of \\\\(n\\\\) over all test cases is \\\\(\\\\le 2\\\\cdot10^5\\\\), this runs in \\\\(O(2\\\\cdot10^5)\\\\), easily within the 2-second time limit.
