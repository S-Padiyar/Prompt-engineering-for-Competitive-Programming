    "content": "**Analysis**\n\nWe have \\(n\\) rectangles, where the \\(i\\)-th rectangle has width \\(a_i\\) (so \\(a_i\\) columns) and height \\(b_i\\) (so \\(b_i\\) rows).  We may color cells one by one; each time we have completely colored all the cells in one row of a rectangle, we gain 1 point, and similarly for each column completely colored we gain 1 point.  We want to accumulate at least \\(k\\) points total across all rectangles, using as few single‐cell colorings (operations) as possible.\n\nA key observation is that within a single rectangle of size \\(a \\times b\\), if we decide to color \\(x\\) full rows and \\(y\\) full columns, we get \\(x+y\\) points, and the number of distinct cells we must color is\n\\[\n  \\underbrace{x\\cdot a}_{\\substack{\\text{coloring }x\\text{ rows}\\\\(\\text{each has }a\\text{ cells})}}\n+ \\underbrace{y\\cdot b}_{\\substack{\\text{coloring }y\\text{ columns}\\\\(\\text{each has }b\\text{ cells})}}\n- \\underbrace{x\\,y}_{\\substack{\\text{overlap of those }x\\text{ rows}\\\\\\phantom{\\text{overlap }}\\text{and }y\\text{ columns}}}\n\\;=\\; x\\,a \\;+\\; y\\,b \\;-\\; x\\,y.\n\\]\nWe can choose any \\(0\\le x\\le b\\), \\(0\\le y\\le a\\).  Letting \\(p=x+y\\), for each \\(p\\) between \\(0\\) and \\(\\min(a+b,k)\\) we can compute the minimum cost\n\\[\n  \\text{rect\\_dp}[p]\n  \\;=\\;\\min_{x+y=p}\\;\\bigl[x\\,a + y\\,b - x\\,y\\bigr].\n\\]\nThat gives us, for this single rectangle, the minimal number of colored cells needed to earn exactly \\(p\\) points from it (where \\(0\\le p\\le k\\)).\n\nOnce we have for every rectangle its array \\(\\text{rect\\_dp}[\\cdot]\\), we are left with a standard bounded‐knapsack–style or “grouped knapsack” problem:\n\nWe maintain a DP array\n\\[\n  \\text{dp}[j]\n  \\;=\\;\\text{minimum total number of colored cells needed to get exactly }j\\text{ points so far},\n\\]\nfor \\(0\\le j\\le k\\).  Initially \\(\\text{dp}[0]=0\\) and \\(\\text{dp}[1\\ldots k]=\\infty\\).  Then for each rectangle (its array \\(\\text{rect\\_dp}\\)), we form a new DP array \\(\\text{ndp}\\) by\n\n```\n ndp[0..k] = +∞\n for j in [0..k]:\n   for p in [0..k]:\n     new_points = min(k, j + p);\n     ndp[new_points] = min(ndp[new_points], dp[j] + rect_dp[p]);\n dp = ndp\n```\n\nFinally, after processing all \\(n\\) rectangles, \\(\\text{dp}[k]\\) is the least number of single‐cell operations needed to earn \\(\\ge k\\) points (we cap any total points above \\(k\\) back down to \\(k\\)).  If \\(\\text{dp}[k]\\) remains \\(\\infty\\), the task is impossible, and we print \\(-1\\).\n\nThe time complexity per test is roughly\n- \\(O(n\\cdot (a_i+1)\\cdot(b_i+1))\\) to build all the \\(\\text{rect\\_dp}\\) tables (in the worst case each \\(a_i,b_i\\le 100\\), so up to \\(10^4\\) per rectangle),\n- \\(O(n\\cdot k^2)\\) to do the knapsack merges (\\(k\\le 100\\)).\n\nSince \\(\\sum n\\le 1000\\) over all tests and \\(k\\le 100\\), this easily fits within typical time limits.\n\n---\n\n```java\nimport java.io.*;\nimport java.util.*;\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\n        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));\n        StringTokenizer st;\n\n        int T = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine().trim());\n        final int INF = 1_000_000_000;\n\n        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\n        while (T-- > 0) {\n            st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\n            int n = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\n            int K = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\n\n            // dp[j] = minimal operations needed to get exactly j points so far\n            int[] dp = new int[K+1];\n            Arrays.fill(dp, INF);\n            dp[0] = 0;\n\n            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\n                int a = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken()); // width (columns)\n                int b = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken()); // height (rows)\n\n                // Build rect_dp[p] = minimal cost to earn exactly p points from this rectangle\n                int[] rect_dp = new int[K+1];\n                Arrays.fill(rect_dp, INF);\n                rect_dp[0] = 0;\n\n                // Try all combinations x rows, y columns\n                for (int x = 0; x <= b; x++) {\n                    for (int y = 0; y <= a; y++) {\n                        int p = x + y;\n                        if (p > K) continue;\n                        int cost = x*a + y*b - x*y;  // count of distinct cells colored\n                        rect_dp[p] = Math.min(rect_dp[p], cost);\n                    }\n                }\n\n                // Merge this rectangle's choices into the global dp\n                int[] ndp = new int[K+1];\n                Arrays.fill(ndp, INF);\n\n                for (int got = 0; got <= K; got++) {\n                    if (dp[got] == INF) continue;\n                    for (int add = 0; add <= K; add++) {\n                        if (rect_dp[add] == INF) continue;\n                        int to = got + add;\n                        if (to > K) to = K;\n                        ndp[to] = Math.min(ndp[to], dp[got] + rect_dp[add]);\n                    }\n                }\n\n                dp = ndp;  // move on\n            }\n\n            int ans = dp[K];\n            if (ans >= INF) sb.append(-1).append('\\n');\n            else sb.append(ans).append('\\n');\n        }\n\n        System.out.print(sb);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation of Key Steps**\n\n1. **Single-Rectangle DP (`rect_dp`)**  \n   For a rectangle of size \\(a\\times b\\), if you color \\(x\\) rows and \\(y\\) columns you earn \\(x+y\\) points at a cost of \n   \\[\n     x\\cdot a + y\\cdot b \\;-\\; x\\,y\n   \\]\n   because the \\(x\\) rows each have \\(a\\) cells, the \\(y\\) columns each have \\(b\\) cells, and we subtract the \\(x\\,y\\) double‐counted intersection cells.  \n   We loop \\(0\\le x\\le b\\), \\(0\\le y\\le a\\), compute \\(p=x+y\\) (capped to \\(\\le K\\)), and keep the minimum cost for each \\(p\\).\n\n2. **Global Knapsack‐Style DP (`dp`)**  \n   We maintain `dp[j]` = minimal operations to gather exactly \\(j\\) points so far (points above \\(K\\) are merged into the state \\(K\\)).  Initially `dp[0]=0`, others ∞.  \n   For each rectangle’s `rect_dp`, we do a standard “combine choice” loop, resulting in an updated DP array, ensuring we end up with the minimal cost to get any total \\(0\\le j\\le K\\).\n\n3. **Answer**  \n   After processing all rectangles, `dp[K]` is the least cost to get at least \\(K\\) points.  If it is still ∞, we output \\(-1\\); otherwise we print that cost.\n\nThis runs in \\(O(n\\cdot (a_i+1)(b_i+1) + n\\cdot K^2)\\), which suffices for \\(n\\le 1000\\), \\(a_i,b_i\\le 100\\), and \\(K\\le 100\\)."
