Field Division (hard version)\n\ntime limit per test3 seconds\n\nmemory limit per test256 megabytes\n\nThis is a hard version of the problem; it differs from the easy version only by the question. The easy version only needs you to print whether some values are non-zero or not. The hard version needs you to print the exact values.\n\n\n\nAlice and Bob are dividing the field. The field is a rectangle of size n×m\n\n (2≤n,m≤109\n\n); the rows are numbered from 1\n\n to n\n\n from top to bottom, and the columns are numbered from 1\n\n to m\n\n from left to right. The cell at the intersection of row r\n\n and column c\n\n is denoted as (r,c\n\n).\n\n\n\nBob has k\n\n (2≤k≤2⋅105\n\n) fountains, all of them are located in different cells of the field. Alice is responsible for dividing the field, but she must meet several conditions:\n\n\n\nTo divide the field, Alice will start her path in any free (without a fountain) cell on the left or top side of the field and will move, each time moving to the adjacent cell down or right. Her path will end on the right or bottom side of the field.\n\nAlice's path will divide the field into two parts — one part will belong to Alice (this part includes the cells of her path), the other part — to Bob.\n\nAlice will own the part that includes the cell (n,1\n\n).\n\nBob will own the part that includes the cell (1,m\n\n).\n\nAlice wants to divide the field in such a way as to get as many cells as possible.\n\n\n\nBob wants to keep ownership of all the fountains, but he can give one of them to Alice. First, output the integer α\n\n — the maximum possible size of Alice's plot, if Bob does not give her any fountain (i.e., all fountains will remain on Bob's plot).\n\n\n\nThen output k\n\n non-negative integers a1,a2,…,ak\n\n, where ai\n\n is a value such that after Bob gives Alice the i\n\n-th fountain, the maximum size of her plot will be α+ai\n\n.\n\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t\n\n (1≤t≤104\n\n) — the number of test cases.\n\n\n\nThe first line of each test case contains three integers n\n\n, m\n\n, and k\n\n (2≤n,m≤109\n\n, 2≤k≤2⋅105\n\n) — the field sizes and the number of fountains, respectively.\n\n\n\nThen follow k\n\n lines, each containing two numbers ri\n\n and ci\n\n (1≤ri≤n\n\n, 1≤ci≤m\n\n) — the coordinates of the cell with the i\n\n-th fountain. It is guaranteed that all cells are distinct and none of them is (n,1\n\n).\n\n\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of k\n\n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105\n\n.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, first output α\n\n — the maximum size of the plot that can belong to Alice if Bob does not give her any of the fountains. Then output k\n\n non-negative integers a1,a2,…,ak\n\n, where ai\n\n is a value such that after Bob gives Alice the i\n\n-th fountain, the maximum size of her plot will be α+ai\n\n.\n\n\n\nExample\n\nInputCopy\n\n5\n\n2 2 3\n\n1 1\n\n1 2\n\n2 2\n\n5 5 4\n\n1 2\n\n2 2\n\n3 4\n\n4 3\n\n2 5 9\n\n1 2\n\n1 5\n\n1 1\n\n2 2\n\n2 4\n\n2 5\n\n1 4\n\n2 3\n\n1 3\n\n6 4 4\n\n6 2\n\n1 3\n\n1 4\n\n1 2\n\n3 4 5\n\n2 1\n\n3 2\n\n1 4\n\n1 3\n\n2 4\n\nOutputCopy\n\n1\n\n1 0 1 \n\n11\n\n0 1 0 4 \n\n1\n\n0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 \n\n6\n\n15 0 0 0 \n\n1\n\n2 3 0 0 0 \n\nNote\n\nBelow are the images for the second example:\n\n\n\nThe indices of the fountains are labeled in green.

Each such point forces Bob to include the axis‐aligned rectangle\\n   \\\\[\\n     [1..r_i]\\\\times[c_i..m].\\n   \\\\]\\n   The *minimal* Bob‐region is the union of those \\\\((k\\\\!+\\\\!1)\\\\) rectangles.  Its area \\\\(S\\\\) is easy to compute if you note that at each column \\\\(x\\\\), the union’s vertical extent is\\n   \\\\(\\\\max\\\\{\\\\,r_i : c_i\\\\le x\\\\}\\\\).\\n\\n2. **Compressing Columns.**  \\n   Let \\\\(d_1<d_2<\\\\cdots<d_T=m\\\\) be the distinct sorted “left‐edges” \\\\(c_i\\\\).  On the interval \\\\(x\\\\in[d_j,d_{j+1}-1]\\\\), the set of active rectangles is exactly those with \\\\(c_i\\\\le d_j\\\\), so the height is\\n   \\\\(\\\\max r_i\\\\) among those.  We sweep in increasing order of \\\\(c\\\\), maintaining the top two \\\\(r\\\\)-values\\n   \\\\[\\n     \\\\text{top1}=\\\\max r_i,\\\\quad\\n     \\\\text{top2}=\\\\text{second‐largest }r_i,\\n   \\\\]\\n   and how many rectangles achieve \\\\(\\\\text{top1}\\\\).  \\n\\n3. **Computing \\\\(S\\\\) and the “Exclusive” Areas \\\\(a_i\\\\).**  \\n   - On each segment of width \\\\(\\\\ell_j\\\\), the union area picks up \\\\(\\\\ell_j\\\\cdot \\\\text{top1}\\\\).  \\n   - If exactly one rectangle attains \\\\(\\\\text{top1}\\\\), say rectangle \\\\(i\\\\), then removing that rectangle drops the height on that segment from \\\\(\\\\text{top1}\\\\) to \\\\(\\\\text{top2}\\\\).  Hence rectangle \\\\(i\\\\) alone contributed\\n     \\\\(\\\\ell_j\\\\bigl(\\\\text{top1}-\\\\text{top2}\\\\bigr)\\\\) to the union area.  We add that into \\\\(a_i\\\\).\\n\\n4. **Final Answers.**  \\n   - \\\\(\\\\displaystyle \\\\alpha = nm - S\\\\).  \\n   - And \\\\(a_i\\\\) is exactly how much Alice’s area grows if Bob “gives” her fountain \\\\(i\\\\).  \\n\\nThis runs in \\\\(O((k+1)\\\\log(k+1))\\\\) time and \\\\(O(k)\\\\) extra space, easily handling \\\\(k\\\\) up to \\\\(2\\\\cdot10^5\\\\).\",\n        \"refusal\": null,\n        \"role\": \"assistant\",\n        \"annotations\": [],\n        \"audio\": null,\n        \"function_call\": null,\n        \"tool_calls\": null\n      },\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"protected_material_code\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"protected_material_text\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"created\": 1753396708,\n  \"model\": \"o4-mini-2025-04-16\",\n  \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n  \"service_tier\": null,\n  \"system_fingerprint\": null,\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"completion_tokens\": 15551,\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 979,\n    \"total_tokens\": 16530,\n    \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n      \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"reasoning_tokens\": 13248,\n      \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n    },\n    \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"cached_tokens\": 0\n    }\n  },\n  \"prompt_filter_results\": [\n    {\n      \"prompt_index\": 0,\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"jailbreak\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
