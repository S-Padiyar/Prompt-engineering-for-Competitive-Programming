Shuffle\n\ntime limit per test2 seconds\n\nmemory limit per test256 megabytes\n\nTwo hungry red pandas, Oscar and Lura, have a tree T\n\n with n\n\n nodes. They are willing to perform the following shuffle procedure on the whole tree T\n\n exactly once. With this shuffle procedure, they will create a new tree out of the nodes of the old tree.\n\n\n\nChoose any node V\n\n from the original tree T\n\n. Create a new tree T2\n\n, with V\n\n as the root.\n\nRemove V\n\n from T\n\n, such that the original tree is split into one or more subtrees (or zero subtrees, if V\n\n is the only node in T\n\n).\n\nShuffle each subtree with the same procedure (again choosing any node as the root), then connect all shuffled subtrees' roots back to V\n\n to finish constructing T2\n\n.\n\nAfter this, Oscar and Lura are left with a new tree T2\n\n. They can only eat leaves and are very hungry, so please find the maximum number of leaves over all trees that can be created in exactly one shuffle.\n\n\n\nNote that leaves are all nodes with degree 1\n\n. Thus, the root may be considered as a leaf if it has only one child.\n\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer t\n\n (1≤t≤104\n\n) — the number of test cases.\n\n\n\nThe first line of every test case contains a single integer n\n\n (2≤n≤2⋅105\n\n) — the number of nodes within the original tree T\n\n.\n\n\n\nThe next n−1\n\n lines each contain two integers u\n\n and v\n\n (1≤u,v≤n\n\n) — an edge within the original tree T\n\n. The given edges form a tree.\n\n\n\nThe sum of n\n\n over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅105\n\n.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single integer — the maximum number of leaves achievable with exactly one shuffle procedure on the whole tree.\n\n\n\nExample\n\nInputCopy\n\n4\n\n5\n\n1 2\n\n1 3\n\n2 4\n\n2 5\n\n5\n\n1 2\n\n2 3\n\n3 4\n\n4 5\n\n6\n\n1 2\n\n1 3\n\n1 4\n\n1 5\n\n1 6\n\n10\n\n9 3\n\n8 1\n\n10 6\n\n8 5\n\n7 8\n\n4 6\n\n1 3\n\n10 1\n\n2 7\n\nOutputCopy\n\n4\n\n3\n\n5\n\n6\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, it can be shown that the maximum number of leaves is 4\n\n. To accomplish this, we can start our shuffle with selecting node 3\n\n as the new root.\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we are left only with one subtree, in which we can select node 2\n\n to be the new root of that subtree.\n\n\n\nThis will force all 3\n\n remaining nodes to be leaves, and once we connect them back to our new root, the shuffled subtree looks like this:\n\n\n\nWe connect the shuffled subtree back to our new root of our new tree. Our final tree has four leaves (including the root), and looks like this:\n\n\n\nIn our second test case, we have a line of five nodes. It can be shown that the maximum number of leaves after one shuffle is 3\n\n. We can start off with node 2\n\n, which forces node 1\n\n to become a leaf. Then, if we select node 4\n\n on the right side, we will also have nodes 3\n\n and 5\n\n as leaves.\n\n\n\nThe third test case is a star graph with six nodes. The number of leaves cannot increase, thus our answer will be 5\n\n (if we start the shuffling with the original root node).\n\n---\n\nUse Java."

If you know dpUp[u]=f(C(parent,u)), then for each child v the complementary component at u (with the v-branch cut off) has  \\n     dpUp[v] = (dpUp[u]+∑dpDown[sibling]) + (bonus if that reduced‐degree[u]==0)  \\n   and that must be f(C(u,v)).  \\n\\n3) **take the best center**  \\n   Finally for every node r you do  \\n     bestIfRoot=r = ∑dpDown[child] + dpUp[r]  +  (deg[r]==1?1:0)  \\n   (the final “+1” if r is a leaf in the original tree).  You just take the maximum of those over all r.\\n\\nThis runs in two full DFS passes plus one O(n) scan to extract the maximum, for an overall O(n) per test – more than fast enough for 3·10^5 total nodes.\",\n        \"refusal\": null,\n        \"role\": \"assistant\",\n        \"annotations\": [],\n        \"audio\": null,\n        \"function_call\": null,\n        \"tool_calls\": null\n      },\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"protected_material_code\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": true,\n          \"citation\": {\n            \"URL\": \"https://github.com/XsLel/Solutions/tree/2ec93981737d5fd4345421139f658bc1eee371bf/Codeforces%2FCodeforces%20Round%2FCodeforces%20Round%20%23659%20%28Div.%201%29%2FB.java\",\n            \"license\": \"NOASSERTION\"\n          }\n        },\n        \"protected_material_text\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"created\": 1753317948,\n  \"model\": \"o4-mini-2025-04-16\",\n  \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n  \"service_tier\": null,\n  \"system_fingerprint\": null,\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"completion_tokens\": 21116,\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 786,\n    \"total_tokens\": 21902,\n    \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n      \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"reasoning_tokens\": 19264,\n      \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n    },\n    \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"cached_tokens\": 0\n    }\n  },\n  \"prompt_filter_results\": [\n    {\n      \"prompt_index\": 0,\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"jailbreak\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
