For any vertex i\n\n (1<i≤n\n\n) in the tree, there is an edge connecting vertices i\n\n and pi\n\n (1≤pi<i\n\n), with a weight equal to ti\n\n.\n\n\n\nIris does not know the values of ti\n\n, but she knows that ∑i=2nti=w\n\n and each of the ti\n\n is a non-negative integer.\n\n\n\nThe vertices of the tree are numbered in a special way: the numbers of the vertices in each subtree are consecutive integers. In other words, the vertices of the tree are numbered in the order of a depth-first search.\n\n\n\nThe tree in this picture satisfies the condition. For example, in the subtree of vertex 2\n\n, the vertex numbers are 2,3,4,5\n\n, which are consecutive integers.\n\nThe tree in this picture does not satisfy the condition, as in the subtree of vertex 2\n\n, the vertex numbers 2\n\n and 4\n\n are not consecutive integers.\n\nWe define dist(u,v)\n\n as the length of the simple path between vertices u\n\n and v\n\n in the tree.\n\n\n\nNext, there will be n−1\n\n events:\n\n\n\nIris is given integers x\n\n and y\n\n, indicating that tx=y\n\n.\n\nAfter each event, Iris wants to know the maximum possible value of dist(i,imodn+1)\n\n independently for each i\n\n (1≤i≤n\n\n). She only needs to know the sum of these n\n\n values. Please help Iris quickly get the answers.\n\n\n\nNote that when calculating the maximum possible values of dist(i,imodn+1)\n\n and dist(j,jmodn+1)\n\n for i≠j\n\n, the unknown edge weights may be different.\n\n\n\nInput\n\nEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t\n\n (1≤t≤104\n\n) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.\n\n\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers n\n\n and w\n\n (2≤n≤2⋅105\n\n, 0≤w≤1012\n\n) — the number of vertices in the tree and the sum of the edge weights.\n\n\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n−1\n\n integers p2,p3,…,pn\n\n (1≤pi<i\n\n) — the description of the edges of the tree.\n\n\n\nThen follow n−1\n\n lines indicating the events. Each line contains two integers x\n\n and y\n\n (2≤x≤n\n\n, 0≤y≤w\n\n), indicating that tx=y\n\n.\n\n\n\nIt is guaranteed that all x\n\n in the events are distinct. It is also guaranteed that the sum of all y\n\n equals w\n\n.\n\n\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n\n\n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105\n\n.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output one line containing n−1\n\n integers, each representing the answer after each event.\n\n\n\nExample\n\nInputCopy\n\n4\n\n2 1000000000000\n\n1\n\n2 1000000000000\n\n4 9\n\n1 1 1\n\n2 2\n\n4 4\n\n3 3\n\n6 100\n\n1 2 3 2 1\n\n6 17\n\n3 32\n\n2 4\n\n4 26\n\n5 21\n\n10 511\n\n1 2 2 4 2 1 1 8 8\n\n3 2\n\n6 16\n\n10 256\n\n9 128\n\n2 1\n\n5 8\n\n8 64\n\n4 4\n\n7 32\n\nOutputCopy\n\n2000000000000\n\n25 18 18\n\n449 302 247 200 200\n\n4585 4473 2681 1567 1454 1322 1094 1022 1022\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, dist(1,2)=dist(2,1)=t2=w=1012\n\n, so dist(1,2)+dist(2,1)=2⋅1012\n\n.\n\n\n\nIn the second test case, the tree after Iris found out all tx\n\n is shown below:\n\n\n\n\n\ndist(1,2)=t2\n\n, dist(2,3)=t2+t3\n\n, dist(3,4)=t3+t4\n\n, dist(4,1)=t4\n\n. After the first event, she found out that t2=2\n\n, so dist(1,2)=2\n\n. At the same time:\n\n\n\ndist(2,3)\n\n is maximized if t3=7\n\n, t4=0\n\n. Then dist(2,3)=9\n\n.\n\ndist(3,4)\n\n and dist(4,1)\n\n are maximized if t3=0\n\n, t4=7\n\n. Then dist(3,4)=dist(4,1)=7\n\n.\n\nThus, the answer is 2+9+7+7=25\n\n.\n\n\n\nAfter the second event, she found out that t4=4\n\n, then t3=w−t2−t4=4\n\n. dist(1,2)=2\n\n, dist(2,3)=2+3=5\n\n, dist(3,4)=3+4=7\n\n, dist(4,1)=4\n\n. Thus, the answer is 2+5+7+4=18\n\n.\n\n---\n\nYou are a competitive programming assistant solving Codeforces problems using Java. First, carefully read and restate the problem in your own words to ensure full understanding. Identify the input and output formats, list the constraints, and consider any edge cases that might affect the logic. Next, determine which algorithmic pattern the problem fits best—such as greedy, binary search, two pointers, dynamic programming, or graph traversal—and briefly explain why that pattern applies. Then, plan your solution step by step, describing the key ideas, data structures, or mathematical insights you’ll use. Once your plan is clear, write a clean and fully working Java program. Use import java.util.*; and include a Main class with a main method, using Scanner or BufferedReader for input depending on the constraints. Add comments to explain important logic in the code. After coding, walk through a sample input manually to show how your solution works in practice. Finally, analyze the time and space complexity of your approach using Big-O notation, justifying your answer. Think step by step and only write code once the logic is sound and complete."

Moreover \\\\(L_i=i\\\\).  We compute \\\\(R_i\\\\) (the maximum label in \\\\(i\\\\)’s subtree) by a single downward pass: initially \\\\(R_i=i\\\\), then for \\\\(i=n\\\\) down to \\\\(2\\\\) do  \\n   ```\\n   R[parent[i]] = max(R[parent[i]], R[i]);\\n   ```\\n   so that each parent’s \\\\(R\\\\) becomes the maximum of its children’s intervals.\\n\\n2. **Which pairs does an edge cover?**  \\n   An edge \\\\((i,\\\\;p_i)\\\\) lies “between” the DFS subtree of \\\\(i\\\\) and the rest of the tree.  It is crossed by exactly two adjacent‐pairs \\\\((k,k+1)\\\\) (mod \\\\(n\\\\)):  \\n   (a) the “entering” boundary \\\\((i-1,i)\\\\),  \\n   (b) the “exiting” boundary \\\\((R_i,R_i+1)\\\\).  \\n   We label the pairs \\\\(1,\\\\dots,n\\\\) by their lower endpoint: pair \\\\(j\\\\) is \\\\((j,j+1)\\\\) (and pair \\\\(n\\\\) means \\\\((n,1)\\\\) mod \\\\(n\\\\)).  Thus edge \\\\(i\\\\) contributes +1 to counters `cnt[i-1]` and `cnt[R[i]]`.\\n\\n3. **Maintaining the count \\\\(C\\\\)**  \\n   Let `cnt[j]` = how many *unknown* edges currently cover pair‐index \\\\(j\\\\).  A pair \\\\(j\\\\) has at least one unknown edge on its path iff `cnt[j]>0`.  So \\n   \\\\[\\n     C = \\\\#\\\\{\\\\,j : cnt[j]>0\\\\}.\\n   \\\\]\\n   Initially every edge is unknown, so each boundary has coverage \\\\(\\\\ge1\\\\); hence \\\\(C=n\\\\).  \\n   When an edge becomes **fixed**, we subtract 1 from its two boundaries; if `cnt[..]` drops to zero, we decrement \\\\(C\\\\).  \\n\\n4. **Computing the answer**  \\n   As shown above,\\n   \\\\[\\n     \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\max\\\\mathrm{dist}(i,i+1)\\n     = 2\\\\,(S_{\\\\rm fixed}) \\\\;+\\\\; C\\\\,(w - S_{\\\\rm fixed}).\\n   \\\\]\\n   We keep a running `S_fixed += y` as we learn each edge’s weight \\\\(y\\\\).  Then we output\\n   ```\\n   ans = 2*S_fixed + C*(w - S_fixed)\\n   ```\\n   after each event.\\n\\n**Complexity**\\n\\n- Preprocessing each test in \\\\(O(n)\\\\):\\n  - Building `R[]`: one pass from \\\\(n\\\\) down to 2.\\n  - Initializing `cnt[]`: loop over edges 2..n.\\n- Each of the \\\\(n-1\\\\) events is handled in \\\\(O(1)\\\\).\\n- Over all test cases the sum of \\\\(n\\\\) is \\\\(\\\\le2\\\\times10^5\\\\), so total time \\\\(O(\\\\sum n)\\\\approx O(2\\\\cdot10^5)\\\\).  \\n- Space \\\\(O(n)\\\\) for parent, \\\\(R\\\\), and `cnt` arrays.\\n\\nThis runs comfortably under the given limits.\",\n        \"refusal\": null,\n        \"role\": \"assistant\",\n        \"annotations\": [],\n        \"audio\": null,\n        \"function_call\": null,\n        \"tool_calls\": null\n      },\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"protected_material_code\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"protected_material_text\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"created\": 1753326294,\n  \"model\": \"o4-mini-2025-04-16\",\n  \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n  \"service_tier\": null,\n  \"system_fingerprint\": null,\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"completion_tokens\": 9551,\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 1381,\n    \"total_tokens\": 10932,\n    \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n      \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"reasoning_tokens\": 6784,\n      \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n    },\n    \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"cached_tokens\": 1024\n    }\n  },\n  \"prompt_filter_results\": [\n    {\n      \"prompt_index\": 0,\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"jailbreak\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
