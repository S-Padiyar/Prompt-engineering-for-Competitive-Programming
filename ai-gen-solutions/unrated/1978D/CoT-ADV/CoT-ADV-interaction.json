There are n\n\n candidates participating in the elections, numbered from 1\n\n to n\n\n. The i\n\n-th candidate has ai\n\n fans who will vote for him. Additionally, there are c\n\n people who are undecided about their favorite candidate, let's call them undecided. Undecided people will vote for the candidate with the lowest number.\n\n\n\nThe candidate who receives the maximum number of votes wins the elections, and if multiple candidates receive the same maximum number of votes, the candidate with the lowest number among them wins.\n\n\n\nYou found these elections too boring and predictable, so you decided to exclude some candidates from them. If you do not allow candidate number i\n\n to participate in the elections, all ai\n\n of his fans will become undecided, and will vote for the candidate with the lowest number.\n\n\n\nYou are curious to find, for each i\n\n from 1\n\n to n\n\n, the minimum number of candidates that need to be excluded from the elections for candidate number i\n\n to win the elections.\n\n\n\nInput\n\nEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t\n\n (1≤t≤2⋅104\n\n) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.\n\n\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers n\n\n and c\n\n (1≤n≤2⋅105\n\n, 0≤c≤109\n\n) — the number of candidates in the elections and the number of undecided people.\n\n\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n\n\n integers a1,a2,…,an\n\n (0≤ai≤109\n\n) — the number of fans for each candidate.\n\n\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n\n\n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105\n\n.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output n\n\n integers, the i\n\n-th of which should be equal to the minimum number of candidates that need to be excluded from the elections for candidate number i\n\n to win.\n\n\n\nExample\n\nInputCopy\n\n5\n\n3 1\n\n2 0 3\n\n2 3\n\n0 10\n\n5 3\n\n5 4 3 2 1\n\n4 5\n\n3 10 7 1\n\n6 0\n\n2 2 2 3 3 3\n\nOutputCopy\n\n0 1 2\n\n1 0\n\n0 1 2 3 4\n\n1 0 2 3\n\n1 1 2 0 4 5\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case:\n\n\n\nIf all candidates are allowed, candidate number 1\n\n will receive 3\n\n votes (1\n\n undecided person will vote for him), candidate number 2\n\n will receive 0\n\n votes, and candidate number 3\n\n will receive 3\n\n votes. Therefore, candidate number 1\n\n wins (he received the same number of votes as candidate 3\n\n, but his number is lower), so the answer for him is 0\n\n.\n\nIf candidate number 1\n\n is not allowed, his 2\n\n fans will become undecided. Then candidate number 2\n\n will receive 3\n\n votes (3\n\n undecided people will vote for him) and candidate number 3\n\n will receive 3\n\n votes. Therefore, candidate number 2\n\n wins (he received the same number of votes as candidate 3\n\n, but his number is lower), so the answer for him is 1\n\n.\n\nIf candidates with numbers 1\n\n and 2\n\n are not allowed, candidate number 3\n\n wins, so the answer for him is 2\n\n.\n\nIn the second test case, candidate number 1\n\n will win if candidate number 2\n\n is not allowed to participate.\n\n---\n\nYou are a competitive programming assistant solving Codeforces problems using Java. First, carefully read and restate the problem in your own words to ensure full understanding. Identify the input and output formats, list the constraints, and consider any edge cases that might affect the logic. Next, determine which algorithmic pattern the problem fits best—such as greedy, binary search, two pointers, dynamic programming, or graph traversal—and briefly explain why that pattern applies. Then, plan your solution step by step, describing the key ideas, data structures, or mathematical insights you’ll use. Once your plan is clear, write a clean and fully working Java program. Use import java.util.*; and include a Main class with a main method, using Scanner or BufferedReader for input depending on the constraints. Add comments to explain important logic in the code. After coding, walk through a sample input manually to show how your solution works in practice. Finally, analyze the time and space complexity of your approach using Big-O notation, justifying your answer. Think step by step and only write code once the logic is sound and complete."

Candidate i has a_i “fans” (who will surely vote for him), and there are c “undecided” voters who will go to the remaining candidate with the smallest index.  The winner is the one with the most votes, ties broken by smaller index.\\n\\nWe may **exclude** some candidates from the race.  If candidate j is excluded, his a_j fans become undecided (and will also go to the smallest‐index remaining candidate).  We want, for each i=1…n, the **minimum number of other candidates** we have to exclude so that candidate i ends up winning.\\n\\nFormally:\\n- If we exclude a set S (not containing i), then\\n  - total undecided = original c + ∑_{j∈S}a_j\\n  - let j₀ = the smallest index in the remaining set\\n  - j₀ gets a_{j₀} + (c + ∑_{j∈S}a_j) votes\\n  - any other remaining k≠j₀ gets a_k\\n  - winner is the one with highest votes (ties → smallest index)\\n\\nCompute for each i the minimum |S| so that i is the unique winner.\\n\\n**Outline of the (Greedy+Offline Counting) Solution**\\n\\nWe will combine two strategies:\\n\\n1. **Zero‐exclusion case (“case1”)**  \\n   Candidate i might already win if we exclude no one.  Then all original undecided c go to candidate 1 (the smallest index), and each candidate k≠1 just has a_k votes.  \\n   - If i=1: check  \\n        a₁ + c  ≥  max_{k>1} a_k  \\n     If so, answer[i] = 0.  \\n   - If i>1: then candidate 1 will get a₁ + c votes.  For i to win with no excludes, we need\\n        a_i  >  a₁ + c      (strict, since if tie 1 would win)\\n        a_i  >  max{a₂,…,a_{i−1}}   (strict, since any j<i beats on tie)\\n        a_i  ≥ max{a_{i+1},…,a_n}   (non-strict, because if tie with higher‐index, i wins)\\n     If those hold simultaneously, we set answer[i]=0.\\n\\n2. **“Make i the smallest index remaining” case (“caseA”).**  \\n   Otherwise we *must* exclude all candidates 1…(i−1), so that i becomes the minimum‐index in the race.  \\n   - That’s (i−1) exclusions right away.  That raises the pool of undecided by ∑_{j=1..i−1} a_j.  Let  \\n        U₀ = c + ∑_{j=1..i−1} a_j.  \\n     Then candidate i will have a_i + U₀ votes, and every remaining k>i just has a_k.  \\n   - If a_i + U₀  ≥  max_{k>i} a_k ,  then excluding just 1…(i−1) already suffices.  \\n   - Otherwise any k>i whose a_k > a_i + U_current must be excluded too—and each such exclusion *adds* its a_k to U_current, making i’s total even larger.  Greedily one always excludes the remaining candidate with the largest a_k first, because that both removes the biggest rival vote‐getter and pumps U_current the most.\\n\\n   To compute how many k>i end up needing exclusion, we observe that the process is equivalent to:\\n\\n   ­  Initialize  \\n      t ← 0  \\n      U = U₀  \\n      Let b₁ ≥ b₂ ≥ … ≥ b_m be the a_k of k>i in descending order.  \\n   While t < m and  b_{t+1}  >  a_i + U:  \\n      U ← U + b_{t+1}  \\n      t ← t + 1  \\n   End  \\n   Then t candidates out of the suffix must be excluded; total exclusions = (i−1) + t.\\n\\n   Doing that *directly* for each i is O(n²) in the worst case.  Instead we use an **offline counting** trick:\\n\\n   - Precompute for each i the **threshold**  \\n        X_i = a_i  + (c + ∑_{j=1..i−1} a_j) .  \\n     We then claim that the number of k>i one must eventually exclude is exactly the **count** of suffix‐elements a_k that exceed X_i.  \\n   - Why?  Each a_k that is > X_i *must* be removed in that greedy process anyway; once you remove them all, your U is so big that no remaining suffix‐value can exceed the updated total.  (A formal proof follows standard “pop‐largest‐while‐still‐too‐large” arguments.)\\n\\n   So extra_excluded[i] = |{ k>i : a_k > X_i }|.  \\n   Then answer[i] = (i−1) + extra_excluded[i].\\n\\n**Implementation Steps**\\n\\n1. Read t, loop over test cases.\\n2. For each test:\\n   - Read n, c and array a[1..n].\\n   - Build prefix‐sum pref[i]=∑_{j=1..i}a[j].\\n   - Build prefix max from 2:  pm2[i] = max(a[2..i])  (or –∞ if i<2).\\n   - Build suffix max:  sm[i] = max(a[i+1..n])  (or –∞ if i=n).\\n   - Initialize answer[i]=“infinity” for all i=1..n.\\n3. **Case 1 (zero‐exclude)**:\\n   - i=1: if a[1]+c ≥ sm[1], answer[1]=0.\\n   - For i=2..n:\\n        if ( a[i]>a[1]+c  AND  a[i]>pm2[i−1]  AND  a[i]≥sm[i] )  \\n            answer[i]=0.\\n4. **Case A offline**:\\n   - For each i, compute  \\n       base = i−1  \\n       X_i = a[i] + c + pref[i−1]  \\n     and form a query (i, X_i).  We only *need* to process those i for which answer[i]>0.\\n   - Sort all queries in **descending** order of X_i.\\n   - Also form a list of all candidates k as (a_k, k), sort descending by a_k.\\n   - Use a Fenwick (BIT) over indices 1..n.  We will sweep through the sorted list of (value, k):\\n     - Maintain a pointer p in that list.\\n     - For each query in descending X_i order:\\n        - While p≤n and (value at p) > X_i:\\n            BIT.add( k_of_p , +1 )\\n            p++  \\n        - Now extra_excluded[i] = BIT.sum_range(i+1, n).\\n        - answer[i] = min(answer[i], (i−1) + extra_excluded[i]).\\n5. Print all answer[i].\\n\\n**Complexities**\\n\\n- Building prefix/suffix arrays: O(n).\\n- Case 1 check: O(n).\\n- Sorting the n suffix‐elements: O(n log n).\\n- Sorting the n queries: O(n log n).\\n- BIT operations: each item is added once, each query does one range sum → O(n log n) total.\\n\\nOverall per test O(n log n).  Sum of n over all tests is 2⋅10^5, so we stay within time.\\n\\n```java\\nimport java.io.*;\\nimport java.util.*;\\n\\npublic class Main {\\n    static class Fenwick {\\n        int n;\\n        int[] f;\\n        Fenwick(int n) { this.n = n; f = new int[n+1]; }\\n        void update(int i, int v) {\\n            for (; i<=n; i += i&-i) f[i]+=v;\\n        }\\n        int query(int i) {\\n            int s=0;\\n            for (; i>0; i -= i&-i) s+=f[i];\\n            return s;\\n        }\\n        int rangeSum(int l, int r) {\\n            if (l>r) return 0;\\n            return query(r) - query(l-1);\\n        }\\n    }\\n\\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\\n        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));\\n        int t = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine().trim());\\n        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\\n        while (t-- > 0) {\\n            StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\\n            int n = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\\n            long c = Long.parseLong(st.nextToken());\\n            long[] a = new long[n+1];\\n            st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\\n            for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\\n                a[i] = Long.parseLong(st.nextToken());\\n            }\\n            // prefix sums\\n            long[] pref = new long[n+1];\\n            for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) pref[i] = pref[i-1] + a[i];\\n            // prefix max from 2..i\\n            long[] pm2 = new long[n+1];\\n            pm2[1] = Long.MIN_VALUE;\\n            for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {\\n                pm2[i] = (i==2 ?

Since all undecided voters go to the smallest‐index remaining (i.e. candidate 1), candidate 1 ends up with a₁ + c votes, every other k≠1 has exactly aₖ votes.  From that it is a constant‐time check.\\n\\n2. **Case A (exclude 1…i−1)**  \\n   We must exclude the first (i−1) candidates to make i the smallest index.  That uses up i−1 exclusions, and raises the pool of undecided to  \\n     U₀ = c + ∑_{j=1..i−1} a_j.  \\n   Then candidate i has a_i + U₀, every k>i has only aₖ.  Any k>i with aₖ > (a_i + U_current) *must* be excluded.  Excluding them in descending‐aₖ order is exactly the greedy strategy.  One shows that you end up excluding *precisely* those k for which aₖ > (a_i + U₀), because once you remove all such aₖ, the updated U_current = U₀ + ∑ (those aₖ) is already large enough to dwarf *all* the remaining aₖ.  \\n\\n   Hence **extra_excluded[i] = count of indices k>i with aₖ > (a_i + U₀)**.  \\n\\n3. **Offline Counting**  \\n   We must compute, for each i, how many k>i have aₖ > X_i = a_i + (c + ∑_{1..i−1}a_j).  \\n   - Sort all queries (i,X_i) by descending X_i.  \\n   - Sort all candidate‐values (aₖ,k) by descending aₖ.  \\n   - Sweep: keep a Fenwick tree marking “activated” those k whose aₖ > current X.  For each query we activate all aₖ > X, then query how many activated k lie in (i+1…n).  That is exactly the count we need.  \\n\\nTotal time per test is O(n log n), which is fine for ∑n up to 2×10^5.\\n\\n**Complexity**\\n\\n- Preprocessing (prefix/suffix sums and maxes): O(n)\\n- Case 1 checks: O(n)\\n- Sorting elements and queries: O(n log n)\\n- Fenwick‐tree updates & queries: O(n log n)\\n\\nOverall O(n log n) per test, total O((∑n) log n).\",\n        \"refusal\": null,\n        \"role\": \"assistant\",\n        \"annotations\": [],\n        \"audio\": null,\n        \"function_call\": null,\n        \"tool_calls\": null\n      },\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"protected_material_code\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": true,\n          \"citation\": {\n            \"URL\": \"https://github.com/Ahmed-ShawkyEgy/UVA/tree/af254ea6974e5f8d13e805721895f4b5d77df564/11504%20-%20Domino.java\",\n            \"license\": \"NOASSERTION\"\n          }\n        },\n        \"protected_material_text\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"created\": 1753326234,\n  \"model\": \"o4-mini-2025-04-16\",\n  \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n  \"service_tier\": null,\n  \"system_fingerprint\": null,\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"completion_tokens\": 20681,\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 1019,\n    \"total_tokens\": 21700,\n    \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n      \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"reasoning_tokens\": 17152,\n      \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n    },\n    \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"cached_tokens\": 0\n    }\n  },\n  \"prompt_filter_results\": [\n    {\n      \"prompt_index\": 0,\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"jailbreak\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
