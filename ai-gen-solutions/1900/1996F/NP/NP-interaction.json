Initially our score is 0.  In each operation:\\n\\n- We pick an index \\\\(i\\\\).\\n- We add \\\\(a_i\\\\) to our score.\\n- We then update  \\n  \\\\[\\n    a_i \\\\;\\\\leftarrow\\\\; \\\\max\\\\bigl(0,\\\\,a_i - b_i\\\\bigr).\\n  \\\\]\\n\\nWe may perform up to \\\\(k\\\\) such operations, and we want to maximize the total score.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Reformulation as “take the top-\\\\(k\\\\) values from many arithmetic sequences”\\n\\nObserve that each index \\\\(i\\\\) generates an arithmetic sequence of values\\n\\n\\\\[\\n  a_i,\\\\; a_i - b_i,\\\\; a_i - 2b_i,\\\\; \\\\dots\\n\\\\]\\n\\n(and once we drop to \\\\(0\\\\) or below, further picks yield \\\\(0\\\\)).  Hence the problem of choosing \\\\(k\\\\) operations to maximize the total score is equivalent to choosing the \\\\(k\\\\) largest terms across all these sequences.\\n\\n-  If there are fewer than \\\\(k\\\\) *positive* terms in total, then obviously we just take them all (the rest of our picks, if any, must be zeros).\\n-  Otherwise, let us only consider terms \\\\(\\\\ge1\\\\).  We want the sum of the top \\\\(k\\\\) terms among all positive terms.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Finding the “threshold” via binary search\\n\\nLet us define for an integer \\\\(x\\\\ge1\\\\):\\n\\n\\\\[\\n  C(x)\\\\;=\\\\;\\\\sum_{i=1}^n\\n    \\\\Bigl(\\\\,\\\\text{number of terms in the \\\\(i\\\\)th sequence that are }\\\\ge x\\\\Bigr).\\n\\\\]\\n\\nConcretely, if \\\\(a_i < x\\\\) then that sequence has 0 terms \\\\(\\\\ge x\\\\).  Otherwise,\\n\\n\\\\[\\n  \\\\text{#terms}\\\\;\\\\ge x\\n  \\\\;=\\\\;\\n  \\\\left\\\\lfloor\\\\frac{a_i - x}{b_i}\\\\right\\\\rfloor + 1.\\n\\\\]\\n\\nSince the sequences are strictly decreasing by \\\\(b_i\\\\), the count is exactly that.  Then \\\\(C(x)\\\\) is the total number of all terms across all sequences that are at least \\\\(x\\\\).\\n\\n-  As \\\\(x\\\\) grows, \\\\(C(x)\\\\) is nonincreasing.\\n-  If \\\\(C(x)\\\\ge k\\\\), it means there are at least \\\\(k\\\\) terms \\\\(\\\\ge x\\\\).  \\n-  We want the largest \\\\(x\\\\) (call it \\\\(X\\\\)) for which \\\\(C(X)\\\\ge k\\\\).  \\n\\nOnce we have that threshold \\\\(X\\\\), we know:\\n\\n1.  Exactly \\\\(C(X)\\\\) terms are \\\\(\\\\ge X\\\\).\\n2.  Exactly \\\\(C(X+1)\\\\) terms are \\\\(\\\\ge X+1\\\\), i.e. strictly \\\\(>X\\\\).\\n3.  Hence exactly\\n   \\\\[\\n     M \\\\;=\\\\; C(X+1)\\n   \\\\]\\n   terms are strictly greater than \\\\(X\\\\).  We will definitely take all \\\\(M\\\\) of those.\\n4.  Then to make our total operations up to \\\\(k\\\\), we need \\\\((k-M)\\\\) more picks, each of value exactly \\\\(X\\\\).  \\n\\nSo the total score is\\n\\n\\\\[\\n  \\\\underbrace{\\\\sum(\\\\text{all values}>X)}_{\\\\text{take all}} \\n  \\\\;+\\\\;\\n  (k - M)\\\\;\\\\times\\\\; X.\\n\\\\]\\n\\nWe can compute\\n\\n-  \\\\(M = C(X+1)\\\\) by the same counting formula,\\n-  and also the sum of all terms strictly greater than \\\\(X\\\\) by summing the first\\n   \\\\(\\\\lfloor\\\\frac{a_i - (X+1)}{b_i}\\\\rfloor + 1\\\\) terms of each arithmetic sequence.\\n\\nWe must not forget the special case that there may be fewer than \\\\(k\\\\) *positive* terms in all.  In that case we simply sum *all* positive terms and stop (the remaining picks would be zero in any case).\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Complexity\\n\\n-  We do a binary search on \\\\(x\\\\) in the range \\\\([1,\\\\max_i a_i]\\\\), which takes \\\\(O(\\\\log A)\\\\) steps where \\\\(A=\\\\max a_i\\\\le10^9\\\\).\\n-  Each step we do an \\\\(O(n)\\\\) pass to compute \\\\(C(x)\\\\) (but we clamp the running sum at \\\\(k\\\\) so we rarely overflow).\\n-  Summing and counting the final answer is another \\\\(O(n)\\\\) pass.\\n\\nSince \\\\(\\\\sum n \\\\le 2\\\\times10^5\\\\) over all testcases and each input is processed in \\\\(O(n\\\\log A)\\\\), this easily runs in time.\\n\\n---\\n\\n```java\\nimport java.io.*;\\nimport java.util.StringTokenizer;\\n\\npublic class Main {\\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\\n        // Fast I/O\\n        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));\\n        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\\n        int t = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine().trim());\\n\\n        while (t-- > 0) {\\n            StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\\n            int n = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\\n            long k = Long.parseLong(st.nextToken());\\n\\n            long[] a = new long[n];\\n            long[] b = new long[n];\\n            long maxA = 0;\\n\\n            // Read array a\\n            st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\\n            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\\n                a[i] = Long.parseLong(st.nextToken());\\n                if (a[i] > maxA) {\\n                    maxA = a[i];\\n                }\\n            }\\n            // Read array b\\n            st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\\n            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\\n                b[i] = Long.parseLong(st.nextToken());\\n            }\\n\\n            // First compute how many strictly positive terms there are in all sequences\\n            long totalPositive = 0;\\n            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\\n                // number of j >= 0 with a[i] - j*b[i] >= 1\\n                // => j <= (a[i]-1)/b[i]\\n                long count = (a[i] >= 1 ?
