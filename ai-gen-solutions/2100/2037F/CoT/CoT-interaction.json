You decide to use her in combat.\n\n\n\nThere are n\n\n enemies in a line. The i\n\n'th enemy from the left has health hi\n\n and is currently at position xi\n\n. Xilonen has an attack damage of m\n\n, and you are ready to defeat the enemies with her.\n\n\n\nXilonen has a powerful \"ground stomp\" attack. Before you perform any attacks, you select an integer p\n\n and position Xilonen there (p\n\n can be any integer position, including a position with an enemy currently). Afterwards, for each attack, she deals m\n\n damage to an enemy at position p\n\n (if there are any), m−1\n\n damage to enemies at positions p−1\n\n and p+1\n\n, m−2\n\n damage to enemies at positions p−2\n\n and p+2\n\n, and so on. Enemies that are at least a distance of m\n\n away from Xilonen take no damage from attacks.\n\n\n\nFormally, if there is an enemy at position x\n\n, she will deal max(0,m−|p−x|)\n\n damage to that enemy each hit. Note that you may not choose a different p\n\n for different attacks.\n\n\n\nOver all possible p\n\n, output the minimum number of attacks Xilonen must perform to defeat at least k\n\n enemies. If it is impossible to find a p\n\n such that eventually at least k\n\n enemies will be defeated, output −1\n\n instead. Note that an enemy is considered to be defeated if its health reaches 0\n\n or below.\n\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t\n\n (1≤t≤104\n\n) – the number of test cases.\n\n\n\nThe first line of each test case contains three integers n\n\n, m\n\n, and k\n\n (1≤k≤n≤105\n\n, 1≤m≤109\n\n).\n\n\n\nThe following line contains n\n\n integers h1,h2,...,hn\n\n (1≤hi≤109\n\n).\n\n\n\nThe last line of each testcase contains n\n\n integers x1,x2,...,xn\n\n (1≤xi≤109\n\n, xi<xi+1\n\n for all 1≤i<n\n\n)\n\n\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n\n\n over all test cases does not exceed 105\n\n.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output an integer on a new line, the minimum number of attacks that must be performed to defeat at least k\n\n enemies. If it is impossible to find a p\n\n such that eventually at least k\n\n enemies will be defeated, output −1\n\n instead.\n\n\n\nExample\n\nInputCopy\n\n6\n\n5 5 3\n\n7 7 7 7 7\n\n1 2 3 4 5\n\n9 5 9\n\n2 4 6 8 10 8 6 4 2\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\n2 10 2\n\n1 1\n\n1 20\n\n2 10 1\n\n69696969 420420420\n\n1 20\n\n2 10 2\n\n10 15\n\n1 19\n\n2 2 2\n\n1000000000 1\n\n1 3\n\nOutputCopy\n\n2\n\n2\n\n-1\n\n6969697\n\n15\n\n1000000000\n\nNote\n\nIn the first testcase, it is optimal to select p=2\n\n. Each attack, the first enemy takes 5−|2−1|=4\n\n damage, the second enemy takes 5\n\n damage, the third enemy takes 4\n\n damage, the fourth enemy takes 3\n\n damage, and the fifth enemy takes 2\n\n damage. After 2\n\n attacks, the first three enemies will be defeated. It can be shown that it is impossible to defeat 3\n\n enemies in less than 2\n\n attacks, no matter which p\n\n is selected.\n\n\n\nIn the second testcase, we must kill all 9\n\n enemies. By selecting p=5\n\n, all nine enemies will be defeated in 2\n\n attacks.\n\n\n\nIn the third testcase, we must kill both enemies. However, it can be shown that no p\n\n selected will damage both enemies at the same time, so the answer is −1\n\n.\n\n\n\nIn the fourth testcase, selecting p=1\n\n will enable us to defeat the first enemy in 6969697\n\n attacks.\n\n\n\nIn the fifth testcase, selecting p=10\n\n will make each enemy take 1\n\n damage per attack. Both enemies will be defeated in 15\n\n attacks.\n\n---\n\nLet's think step-by-step so we don't make mistakes. Use Java. Avoid syntax errors or infinite loops."
