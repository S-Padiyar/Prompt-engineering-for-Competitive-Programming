In the three versions, the constraints on n\n\n and m\n\n are different. You can make hacks only if all the versions of the problem are solved.\n\n\n\nPak Chanek is setting up internet connections for the village of Khuntien. The village can be represented as a connected simple graph with n\n\n houses and m\n\n internet cables connecting house ui\n\n and house vi\n\n, each with a latency of wi\n\n.\n\n\n\nThere are p\n\n houses that require internet. Pak Chanek can install servers in at most k\n\n of the houses. The houses that need internet will then be connected to one of the servers. However, since each cable has its latency, the latency experienced by house si\n\n requiring internet will be the maximum latency of the cables between that house and the server it is connected to.\n\n\n\nFor each k=1,2,…,n\n\n, help Pak Chanek determine the minimum total latency that can be achieved for all the houses requiring internet.\n\n\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t\n\n (1≤t≤100\n\n). The description of the test cases follows.\n\n\n\nThe first line of each test case contains three integers n\n\n, m\n\n, p\n\n (2≤n≤400\n\n; n−1≤m≤400\n\n; 1≤p≤n\n\n) — the number of houses, the number of cables and the number of houses that need internet.\n\n\n\nThe second line of each test case contains p\n\n integers s1,s2,…,sp\n\n (1≤si≤n\n\n) — the houses that need internet. It is guaranteed that all elements of s\n\n are distinct.\n\n\n\nThe i\n\n-th of the next m\n\n lines of each test case contains three integers ui\n\n, vi\n\n, and wi\n\n (1≤ui<vi≤n\n\n; 1≤wi≤109\n\n) — the internet cable connecting house ui\n\n and house vi\n\n with latency of wi\n\n. It is guaranteed that the given edges form a connected simple graph.\n\n\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n3\n\n and the sum of m3\n\n do not exceed 108\n\n.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output n\n\n integers: the minimum total latency that can be achieved for all the houses requiring internet for each k=1,2,…,n\n\n.\n\n\n\nExample\n\nInputCopy\n\n2\n\n9 8 5\n\n2 5 6 8 9\n\n1 2 1\n\n1 3 2\n\n3 4 10\n\n4 5 3\n\n4 6 5\n\n1 7 10\n\n7 8 4\n\n7 9 2\n\n3 3 2\n\n3 1\n\n1 2 1\n\n2 3 3\n\n1 3 2\n\nOutputCopy\n\n34 19 9 4 0 0 0 0 0\n\n2 0 0\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case for k=3\n\n, a possible optimal solution is to install servers at vertices 2\n\n, 6\n\n and 8\n\n and obtain the following latency:\n\n\n\nlatency(2)=0\n\nlatency(5)=max(3,5)=5\n\nlatency(6)=0\n\nlatency(8)=0\n\nlatency(9)=max(2,4)=4\n\nSo the total latency is 9\n\n.\n\n---\n\nLet's think step-by-step so we don't make mistakes.

A subset \\\\(S\\\\subseteq\\\\{1,\\\\dots,n\\\\}\\\\) of size \\\\(|S|=p\\\\) are the demands (houses that actually need service).  We may open up to \\\\(k\\\\) servers (centers) on *any* of the \\\\(n\\\\) vertices, and then each demand \\\\(s\\\\in S\\\\) connects to the nearest open server in the _minimax_ sense—that is, if the demand \\\\(s\\\\) attaches to server \\\\(t\\\\), its latency is\\n\\n\\\\[\\n  \\\\max_{e\\\\in \\\\text{ path}(s\\\\to t)} w(e).\\n\\\\]\\n\\nWe must compute, for each \\\\(k=1,2,\\\\dots,n\\\\), the minimum possible total latency\\n\\\\[\\n   \\\\sum_{s\\\\in S}\\\\;\\\\bigl(\\\\min_{t\\\\in\\\\text{open servers}}\\\\max_{e\\\\in\\\\mathrm{path}(s\\\\to t)}w(e)\\\\bigr).\\n\\\\]\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Step 1. Compute all‐pairs minimax distances = “bottleneck‐distance.”**\\n\\nIt is well known that the minimax distance\\n\\n\\\\[\\n    D(u,v)\\\\;=\\\\;\\\\min_{\\\\substack{\\\\text{paths }P\\\\text{ from }u\\\\to v}}\\n    \\\\;\\\\max_{e\\\\in P} w(e)\\n\\\\]\\n\\ncan be read off the **minimum‐spanning‐tree** (MST) of the graph; indeed, in any MST the unique path between \\\\(u\\\\) and \\\\(v\\\\) **minimizes** the maximum edge‐weight along \\\\(u\\\\to v\\\\).  We will not explicitly build all \\\\(n\\\\times n\\\\) distances, however, because we need to solve a \\\\(k\\\\)–median style problem on that metric.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Step 2. Build the “merge tree” (DSU‐tree) from Kruskal.**\\n\\nWe run Kruskal’s MST algorithm, but each time we actually *merge* two components \\\\(A\\\\) and \\\\(B\\\\) along an edge of weight \\\\(w\\\\), we create a new internal node in a binary tree:\\n\\n```\\n        (new node INDEX, weight = w)\\n           /                  \\\\\\n        root(A)             root(B)\\n```\\n\\nThus the leaves  \\\\(1,2,\\\\dots,n\\\\) are the original vertices, and every edge‐merge in Kruskal becomes an internal node whose “height” is the edge‐weight that caused the union.  In the end we get a rooted binary tree on \\\\(2n-1\\\\) nodes; the root covers all leaves \\\\(\\\\{1,\\\\dots,n\\\\}\\\\) and has the largest MST‐edge weight as its “height.”\\n\\nIn this DSU‐tree, the minimax distance\\n\\\\[\\n   D(u,v)\\\\;=\\\\;\\\\text{height}\\\\bigl(\\\\mathrm{LCA}(u,v)\\\\bigr),\\n\\\\]\\nwhere \\\\(\\\\mathrm{LCA}\\\\) is the least common ancestor in the tree, and “height” is the weight stored in each internal node ( 0 for the leaves).\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Step 3.  DP on the DSU‐tree to solve the ultrametric \\\\(k\\\\)–median.**\\n\\nBecause \\\\(\\\\max\\\\)–distances define an *ultrametric*, there is a neat \\\\(O(n^3)\\\\) DP on the Kruskal‐tree that solves the “pick \\\\(k\\\\) leaves to minimize sum of distances of demand‐leaves to their nearest picked leaf.”\\n\\nWe label each leaf \\\\(i\\\\) by whether it is a demand (\\\\(d_i=1\\\\)) or not (\\\\(d_i=0\\\\)).  In each subtree \\\\(u\\\\), let\\n\\n- \\\\(\\\\mathrm{dem}[u] =\\\\) total # of demands in \\\\(u\\\\)’s leaves,\\n- \\\\(\\\\ell[u] =\\\\) # of leaves in \\\\(u\\\\),\\n- \\\\(\\\\mathrm{dp}_u[t]\\\\) = the minimum total penalty for the demands *inside* subtree \\\\(u\\\\) if we open *exactly* \\\\(t\\\\) servers among *those* \\\\(\\\\ell[u]\\\\) leaves.  \\n\\nBecause in an ultrametric any facility anywhere in the subtree will eventually “cover” all demands in that subtree (paying the appropriate merge‐penalties along the way), one shows that\\n\\n- If \\\\(t>0\\\\), *all* demands in that subtree get covered by some facility in the same subtree, so there are no “left‐over” demands to pay later.\\n- If \\\\(t=0\\\\), *none* are covered locally, and they all have to pay the penalty at the next merge node.\\n\\nHence the **only** bookkeeping DP needs is\\n\\n```\\ndp_u[t]  for t = 0..ℓ[u],\\n```\\n\\nand the combination at an internal node \\\\(u\\\\) with children \\\\(L,R\\\\) and merge‐weight \\\\(w_u\\\\) is\\n\\n```\\n   new_dp_u[t]\\n =  min_{ tL + tR = t }\\n     dp_L[tL]\\n     + dp_R[tR]\\n     +  penalty(tL,tR)\\n```\\n\\nwhere\\n```\\n   penalty(tL,tR)\\n =  if tL>0 and tR=0  :  dem[R] * w_u\\n   else if tR>0 and tL=0 :  dem[L] * w_u\\n   else :  0\\n```\\n-   If exactly one child has no server (t=0), its demands must climb up and get served in the sibling, each paying wₙ.\\n-   If both have server(s), everything got covered inside—no penalty.\\n-   If neither has a server, no one can cover the other, so they remain “uncovered” and will pay later (no penalty yet).\\n\\nAt a leaf \\\\(u\\\\) (one house):\\n\\n```\\ndp_u[0] = 0      (we open 0 servers here ⇒  no local coverage)\\ndp_u[1] = 0      (we open the server at u ⇒  demand at u, if any, is covered at distance 0; if not a demand, it’s just a “wasted” server)\\n```\\n\\nWe build these DP vectors bottom‐up in the order the Kruskal‐tree nodes were created (children have smaller index than parent).  Finally at the root (which has all n leaves) we read off\\n\\n```\\nanswer[k] = dp_root[k] ,   k=1..n.\\n```\\n\\nThis runs in \\\\(O(n^3)\\\\) per test (the big loops over merging two DP tables of total size up to \\\\(n\\\\) give \\\\(O(n^2)\\\\) per internal node, and there are \\\\(n-1\\\\) merges).\\n\\nSince \\\\(n\\\\le 400\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\sum n^3\\\\le10^8\\\\), it fits comfortably in 2 s.\\n\\n---\\n\\n```java\\nimport java.io.*;\\nimport java.util.*;\\n\\npublic class Main {\\n    static final long INF = (long)1e18;\\n\\n    // DSU arrays for building the Kruskal‐tree\\n    static int[] dsu;\\n    static int[] leftChild, rightChild;\\n    static long[] nodeWeight;\\n    static int[] demandCount, leafCount;\\n    static int curNode;

By the end, all original vertices are leaves \\\\(0\\\\ldots n-1\\\\), and the final merge‐node is the root of a binary tree with \\\\(2n-1\\\\) nodes.\\n\\n2. **Counting demands and leaves**  \\n   We store `demandCount[u]` = how many demand‐leaves descend from node \\\\(u\\\\), and `leafCount[u]` = total leaves in \\\\(u\\\\).  \\n   At leaves \\\\(0\\\\ldots n-1\\\\), `leafCount=1` and `demandCount=1` if that leaf is in \\\\(S\\\\), else 0.  \\n   Whenever we make a new internal node \\\\(u\\\\), we do  \\n      leafCount[u] = leafCount[L] + leafCount[R]  \\n      demandCount[u]=demandCount[L]+demandCount[R].\\n\\n3. **Ultrametric \\\\(k\\\\)–median DP**  \\n   For each node \\\\(u\\\\), we build an array  \\n     dp[u][0..leafCount[u]]  \\n   where  \\n     dp[u][t] = minimum total penalty _so far_ if we open exactly \\\\(t\\\\) servers among the leaves of the subtree rooted at \\\\(u\\\\).  \\n\\n   - At a leaf \\\\(u\\\\), clearly  \\n       dp[u][0] = 0   (no server here ⇒ the leaf is “uncovered” until we merge upward)  \\n       dp[u][1] = 0   (we open a server at this leaf ⇒ any demand at \\\\(u\\\\) is covered at zero cost)  \\n\\n   - At an internal node \\\\(u\\\\) with children \\\\(L,R\\\\) and merge‐weight \\\\(w\\\\), we do a double loop over  \\n       \\\\(t_L=0\\\\ldots \\\\ell(L)\\\\),  \\\\(t_R=0\\\\ldots \\\\ell(R)\\\\),  \\\\(t=t_L+t_R\\\\),  \\n     and compute  \\n       penalty =  \\n         –  `demandCount[R]*w` if \\\\(t_L>0\\\\) and \\\\(t_R=0\\\\),  \\n         –  `demandCount[L]*w` if \\\\(t_R>0\\\\) and \\\\(t_L=0\\\\),  \\n         –  0 otherwise,  \\n     then  \\n       dp[u][t] = min(dp[u][t], dp[L][t_L] + dp[R][t_R] + penalty).\\n\\n   This is exactly the known \\\\(O(n^3)\\\\) DP for the ultrametric (max‐edge) distance.\\n\\n4. **Answer**  \\n   The root’s DP table `dp[root]` has size `n+1`; for \\\\(k=1\\\\ldots n\\\\), the minimum total latency is\\n   \\\\[\\n     \\\\mathrm{dp}[\\\\,\\\\mathrm{root}\\\\,][\\\\,k\\\\,].\\n   \\\\]\\n\\nThe overall complexity is \\\\(O(n^3)\\\\) per test, which is fine for \\\\(n\\\\le400\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\sum n^3\\\\le10^8\\\\).\",\n        \"refusal\": null,\n        \"role\": \"assistant\",\n        \"annotations\": [],\n        \"audio\": null,\n        \"function_call\": null,\n        \"tool_calls\": null\n      },\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"protected_material_code\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": true,\n          \"citation\": {\n            \"URL\": \"https://github.com/SUHYEOK97/Algorithm/tree/1d15ee8abe1cacca0cb45c289a31a7bbfdf66386/study%2F%EB%B0%B1%EC%A4%80%2F%EC%A0%84%EA%B8%B0%EA%B0%80%20%EB%B6%80%EC%A1%B1%ED%95%B4.java\",\n            \"license\": \"NOASSERTION\"\n          }\n        },\n        \"protected_material_text\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"created\": 1753311003,\n  \"model\": \"o4-mini-2025-04-16\",\n  \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n  \"service_tier\": null,\n  \"system_fingerprint\": null,\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"completion_tokens\": 12199,\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 759,\n    \"total_tokens\": 12958,\n    \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n      \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"reasoning_tokens\": 8448,\n      \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n    },\n    \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"cached_tokens\": 0\n    }\n  },\n  \"prompt_filter_results\": [\n    {\n      \"prompt_index\": 0,\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"jailbreak\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
