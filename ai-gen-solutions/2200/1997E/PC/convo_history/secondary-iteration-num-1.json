He is about to fight n\n\n monsters, in order from 1\n\n to n\n\n. The level of the i\n\n-th monster is ai\n\n.\n\n\n\nFor each monster in the given order, Monocarp's encounter goes as follows:\n\n\n\nif Monocarp's level is strictly higher than the monster's level, the monster flees (runs away);\n\notherwise, Monocarp fights the monster.\n\nAfter every k\n\n-th fight with a monster (fleeing monsters do not count), Monocarp's level increases by 1\n\n. So, his level becomes 2\n\n after k\n\n monsters he fights, 3\n\n after 2k\n\n monsters, 4\n\n after 3k\n\n monsters, and so on.\n\n\n\nYou need to process q\n\n queries of the following form:\n\n\n\ni x\n\n: will Monocarp fight the i\n\n-th monster (or will this monster flee) if the parameter k\n\n is equal to x\n\n?\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n\n\n and q\n\n (1≤n,q≤2⋅105\n\n) — the number of monsters and the number of queries.\n\n\n\nThe second line contains n\n\n integers a1,a2,…,an\n\n (1≤ai≤2⋅105\n\n) — the levels of the monsters.\n\n\n\nIn the j\n\n-th of the following q\n\n lines, two integers i\n\n and x\n\n (1≤i,x≤n\n\n) — the index of the monster and the number of fights required for a level up in the j\n\n-th query.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each query, output \"YES\", if Monocarp will fight the i\n\n-th monster in this query, and \"NO\", if the i\n\n-th monster flees.\n\n\n\nExamples\n\nInputCopy\n\n4 16\n\n2 1 2 1\n\n1 1\n\n2 1\n\n3 1\n\n4 1\n\n1 2\n\n2 2\n\n3 2\n\n4 2\n\n1 3\n\n2 3\n\n3 3\n\n4 3\n\n1 4\n\n2 4\n\n3 4\n\n4 4\n\nOutputCopy\n\nYES\n\nNO\n\nYES\n\nNO\n\nYES\n\nYES\n\nYES\n\nNO\n\nYES\n\nYES\n\nYES\n\nNO\n\nYES\n\nYES\n\nYES\n\nYES\n\nInputCopy\n\n7 15\n\n1 1 2 1 1 1 1\n\n5 3\n\n2 2\n\n2 2\n\n1 6\n\n5 1\n\n5 5\n\n7 7\n\n3 5\n\n7 4\n\n4 3\n\n2 5\n\n1 2\n\n5 6\n\n4 1\n\n6 1\n\nOutputCopy\n\nNO\n\nYES\n\nYES\n\nYES\n\nNO\n\nYES\n\nYES\n\nYES\n\nNO\n\nNO\n\nYES\n\nYES\n\nYES\n\nNO\n\nNO\n\nUse Java."

If the response looks perfect, return \"Perfect\". Do not return this if there are any issues. Use this very sparingly as any errors in the final output from the AI will be considered a failure on your part. 2. Otherwise, return \"{prompt}\" where {prompt} is replaced with your concise prompt. This should be done most often, even if the AI's response is mostly correct. Ensure the entire response is enclosed in double quotations if it's a prompt.
