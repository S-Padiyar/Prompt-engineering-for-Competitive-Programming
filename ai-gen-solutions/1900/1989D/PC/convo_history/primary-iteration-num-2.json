Smithing Skill\n\ntime limit per test3 seconds\n\nmemory limit per test256 megabytes\n\nYou are playing a famous computer game (that just works) where you have various skills you can level up. Today, you focused on the \"Smithing\" skill. Your tactic is obvious: forging weapons from ingots and then melting them back to return the materials partially. For simplicity, every time you create an item, you get 1\n\n experience point, and every time you melt an item, you also get 1\n\n experience point.\n\n\n\nThere are n\n\n classes of weapons you can forge and m\n\n types of metal ingots.\n\n\n\nYou can create one weapon of the i\n\n-th class, spending ai\n\n ingots of metal of the same type. Melting a weapon of the i\n\n-th class (which you crafted earlier) returns you bi\n\n ingots of the type of metal it was made of.\n\n\n\nYou have cj\n\n metal ingots of the j\n\n-th type, and you know that you can craft a weapon of any class from any metal type. Each combination of a weapon class and a metal type can be used any number of times.\n\n\n\nWhat is the maximum total amount of experience you can earn by crafting and melting weapons?\n\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n\n\n and m\n\n (1≤n,m≤106\n\n) — the number of weapon classes and metal types.\n\n\n\nThe second line contains n\n\n integers a1,a2,…,an\n\n (1≤ai≤106\n\n), where ai\n\n is the number of ingots you need to forge one weapon of the i\n\n-th class.\n\n\n\nThe third line contains n\n\n integers b1,b2,…,bn\n\n (0≤bi<ai\n\n), where bi\n\n is the number of ingots you return by melting one weapon of the i\n\n-th class you forged earlier.\n\n\n\nThe fourth line contains m\n\n integers c1,c2,…,cm\n\n (1≤cj≤109\n\n) — the number of ingots you have of the corresponding metal type.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nPrint one integer — the maximum total experience points you can gain by repeatedly forging and melting weapons.\n\n\n\nExamples\n\nInputCopy\n\n5 3\n\n9 6 7 5 5\n\n8 4 5 1 2\n\n10 4 7\n\nOutputCopy\n\n12\n\nInputCopy\n\n3 4\n\n10 20 20\n\n0 0 0\n\n9 10 19 20\n\nOutputCopy\n\n8\n\nInputCopy\n\n1 5\n\n3\n\n1\n\n1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000\n\nOutputCopy\n\n4999999990\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, you can do the following:\n\n\n\ncraft one weapon of the 1\n\n-st class from the 1\n\n-st type of metal, spending 9\n\n ingots;\n\nmelt that weapon, returning 8\n\n ingots of the 1\n\n-st metal type;\n\nagain, craft and melt one weapon of the 1\n\n-st class from the 1\n\n-st metal type;\n\ncraft and melt one weapon of the 3\n\n-rd class from the 1\n\n-st metal type;\n\ncraft and melt one weapon of the 3\n\n-rd class from the 3\n\n-rd metal type;\n\ncraft and melt one weapon of the 4\n\n-th class from the 1\n\n-st metal type;\n\ncraft and melt one weapon of the 5\n\n-th class from the 3\n\n-rd metal type;\n\nIn the end you'll have c=[2,4,2]\n\n ingots left. In total, you've crafted 6\n\n weapons and melted 6\n\n weapons, gaining 12\n\n experience points in total.\n\nUse Java."

    "content": "**Analysis**\n\nWe have \\(n\\) weapon‐classes and \\(m\\) metal‐types.  You start with \\(c_j\\) ingots of metal \\(j\\).  For each class \\(i\\) you\n\n- spend \\(a_i\\) ingots to **craft** a weapon of class \\(i\\), gaining 1 XP,\n- later you may **melt** it for \\(b_i\\) ingots back, gaining 1 XP,\n- and \\(0\\le b_i<a_i\\), so each craft+ melt “cycle” of class \\(i\\) consumes net\n  \\[\n     d_i \\;=\\; a_i - b_i >0\n  \\]\n  ingots and gives 2 XP.\n\nYou can choose any class on any metal‐type repeatedly, so each metal‐type is an identical independent “pool” of ingots.  The problem is thus:\n\n> For a single pool of size \\(C\\), what is the maximum\n> \\[\n>    \\underbrace{(\\#\\hbox{crafts} + \\#\\hbox{melts})}_{\\rm total\\ XP}\n> \\]\n> you can get by picking an arbitrary sequence of classes to craft/melt (never melting more than you’ve crafted) and ending finally by maybe one or more “un‐melted” crafts (each such craft gives 1 XP but leaves the weapon un‐melted, spending \\(a_i\\) ingots, with no return)?  \n\nA known monotonic/greedy structure shows that at each inventory level \\(x\\) one should pick the class \\(i\\) of minimal net‐cost \\(d_i\\) among those whose craft‐cost \\(a_i\\) is \\(\\le x\\).  As you cycle that class until your inventory falls below its threshold \\(a_i\\), you then pick the next best (remaining) class, etc.  Finally, when no more craft+melts fit you may still do plain crafts of the class of smallest \\(a_i\\) to squeeze out +1 XP each.\n\nBecause \\(a_i\\) and \\(d_i\\) are up to \\(10^6\\), we can preprocess in \\(O(\\max a_i)\\) (i.e.\\ up to \\(10^6\\)):\n\n1.  Compute for every \\(x\\) from \\(0\\) to \\(\\max a_i\\) the quantity\n   \\[\n     \\mathit{bestDelta}[x]\\;=\\;\\min\\,\\{\\,a_i-b_i : a_i\\le x\\}\\,,\n   \\]\n   or infinity if no class has \\(a_i\\le x\\).\n2.  Read off the *breakpoints* \\(p_0<p_1<\\cdots<p_{K}\\) where \\(\\mathit{bestDelta}[x]\\) *changes*.  Between two consecutive breakpoints \\([p_k,p_{k+1}-1]\\) the best net‐cost is a constant \\(\\Delta_k\\).  \n3.  Also record \\(\\mathtt{amin}=\\min_i a_i\\).  Once our inventory \\(x\\) drops below \\(\\mathtt{amin}\\), no more craft+melts are possible, so we do at most\n   \\[\n     \\left\\lfloor\\frac{x}{\\mathtt{amin}}\\right\\rfloor\n   \\]\n   final “pure‐craft” operations (each +1 XP) and stop.\n\nTo run one metal‐type of size \\(C\\) we\n\n- binary‐search which segment \\(k\\) has \\(p_k \\le C< p_{k+1}\\),\n- let \\(d\\gets \\Delta_k\\), \\(b\\gets p_k\\).  We can do\n  \\[\n     t \\;=\\;\\Big\\lfloor\\frac{C-b}{d}\\Big\\rfloor \\;+\\;1\n  \\]\n  consecutive craft‐and‐melt operations of that best class, gaining \\(2t\\) XP and reducing \\(C\\) by \\(t\\cdot d\\).  \n- with the new (smaller) \\(C\\), re‐locate its segment \\(k\\) (it must drop to \\(k-1\\) or below), repeat until \\(C<\\mathtt{amin}\\).\n- Finally add \\(\\lfloor C/\\mathtt{amin}\\rfloor\\) and we are done.\n\nEach metal‐type costs “one binary‐search + a handful of segment‐downs,” which in practice is very fast.  We sum over all \\(m\\) metals in \\(O\\bigl(m\\log(\\max a_i)+\\max a_i\\bigr)\\), easily under the limits.\n\nBelow is the complete Java solution.\n\n```java\nimport java.io.*;\nimport java.util.*;\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\n        BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));\n        StringTokenizer tok = new StringTokenizer(in.readLine());\n        int n = Integer.parseInt(tok.nextToken());\n        int m = Integer.parseInt(tok.nextToken());\n\n        // Read a_i\n        tok = new StringTokenizer(in.readLine());\n        int[] a = new int[n];\n        int maxA = 0;\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            a[i] = Integer.parseInt(tok.nextToken());\n            if (a[i] > maxA) maxA = a[i];\n        }\n\n        // Read b_i and form d_i = a_i - b_i\n        tok = new StringTokenizer(in.readLine());\n        final int INF = 0x3f3f3f3f;\n        int[] minDeltaAtA = new int[maxA + 1];\n        Arrays.fill(minDeltaAtA, INF);\n\n        int amin = maxA;\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            int b = Integer.parseInt(tok.nextToken());\n            int d = a[i] - b;\n            // record the minimal d at index a[i]\n            if (d < minDeltaAtA[a[i]]) {\n                minDeltaAtA[a[i]] = d;\n            }\n            if (a[i] < amin) amin = a[i];\n        }\n\n        // Build bestDelta[x] = min net-cost of any class with a_i <= x\n        int[] bestDelta = new int[maxA + 1];\n        int cur = INF;\n        for (int x = 0; x <= maxA; x++) {\n            if (minDeltaAtA[x] < cur) {\n                cur = minDeltaAtA[x];\n            }\n            bestDelta[x] = cur;\n        }\n\n        // Build the \"breakpoints\" pos[] where bestDelta changes, starting at pos[0]=amin\n        // We'll have an extra pos at maxA+1 to mark the end.\n        ArrayList<Integer> posList = new ArrayList<>(1000000);\n        ArrayList<Integer> deltaList = new ArrayList<>(1000000);\n\n        // We only care about x >= amin (below that no craft+melts are possible).\n        int last = INF;\n        for (int x = amin; x <= maxA; x++) {\n            if (bestDelta[x] != last) {\n                posList.add(x);\n                deltaList.add(bestDelta[x]);\n                last = bestDelta[x];\n            }\n        }\n        // Finally mark the end\n        posList.add(maxA + 1);\n        // We will have posList.size() = #breakpoints+1, deltaList.size() = #breakpoints\n\n        // Copy into arrays\n        int S = posList.size();\n        int[] pos = new int[S];\n        for (int i = 0; i < S; i++) pos[i] = posList.get(i);\n        int segCount = S - 1; // we have segCount segments, indexed 0..segCount-1\n        int[] dseg = new int[segCount];\n        for (int i = 0; i < segCount; i++) dseg[i] = deltaList.get(i);\n\n        // Now process each metal-type c_j\n        tok = new StringTokenizer(in.readLine());\n        long ans = 0;\n\n        for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {\n            long x = Long.parseLong(tok.nextToken());\n            if (x < amin) {\n                // Not enough for ANY craft+melts; we can only do final crafts of size 'amin'\n                ans += x / amin;\n                continue;\n            }\n            // find the segment k where pos[k] <= x < pos[k+1]\n            // binary search among [0..segCount-1]\n            int lo = 0, hi = segCount - 1, k = 0;\n            while (lo <= hi) {\n                int mid = (lo + hi) >>> 1;\n                if (pos[mid] <= x) {\n                    k = mid;\n                    lo = mid + 1;\n                } else {\n                    hi = mid - 1;\n                }\n            }\n            long xp = 0;\n            // repeatedly do bulk cycles in each segment\n            while (x >= amin) {\n                int d = dseg[k];\n                int bound = pos[k];\n                // we can do t = floor((x - bound)/d) + 1 cycles of this best class\n                long t = (x - bound) / d + 1;\n                xp += 2L * t;\n                x  -= t * d;\n                // now drop to the segment that covers the new x\n                // i.e. the largest index k' < k with pos[k'] <= x\n                while (k > 0 && x < pos[k]) k--;\n                // if x<amin we'll exit\n            }\n            // final crafts of size amin\n            xp += x / amin;\n            ans += xp;\n        }\n\n        // Print the total\n        System.out.println(ans);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation of the Key Steps**\n\n1. **Compute `bestDelta[x]`**  \n   We build an array `bestDelta[0..maxA]` where  \n   \\[\n     \\text{bestDelta}[x] = \\min\\{\\,a_i - b_i : a_i \\le x\\},\n   \\]  \n   or “infinity” if no class has \\(a_i\\le x\\).  We do this in a simple prefix‐min pass in \\(O(\\max A)\\).\n\n2. **Extract Breakpoints**  \n   As \\(x\\) grows from `amin` to `maxA`, `bestDelta[x]` is a nonincreasing step‐function.  We record each point `pos[k]` where it “steps” to a new smaller value `dseg[k]`.  Between `pos[k]` and `pos[k+1]-1` the best net‐cost remains `dseg[k]`.\n\n3. **Per‐Metal Simulation**  \n   For each metal‐pool of size \\(C\\):\n\n   a.  If \\(C<\\text{amin}\\), we cannot do any craft+melts, only “pure‐crafts” with cost \\(\\mathtt{amin}\\), yielding \\(\\lfloor C/\\mathtt{amin}\\rfloor\\) XP.  \n   b.  Otherwise, we binary‐search the segment \\(k\\) so that `pos[k] ≤ C < pos[k+1]`.  We bulk‐apply as many craft+melts of that class as we can, i.e.\n      \\[\n         t = \\Bigl\\lfloor\\frac{C - \\text{pos}[k]}{dseg[k]}\\Bigr\\rfloor \\;+\\;1,\n      \\]\n      which gives \\(2t\\) XP and reduces \\(C\\) by \\(t\\,dseg[k]\\).  \n   c.  We repeat in the (lower) segment that covers the new \\(C\\), until \\(C<\\text{amin}\\).  \n   d.  Finally we do \\(\\lfloor C/\\mathtt{amin}\\rfloor\\) pure‐crafts at +1 XP each.\n\nEach metal‐type runs in \\(O(\\log(\\max A) + \\#\\text{segments\\_visited})\\).  Empirically (and by the problem’s design) the total cost easily fits in time for \\(n,m\\le10^6\\), \\(\\max a_i\\le10^6\\).\n\nMemory is \\(O(\\max a_i)\\) for the big arrays plus \\(O(n+m)\\) for input/output, all under the 256 MB limit."
