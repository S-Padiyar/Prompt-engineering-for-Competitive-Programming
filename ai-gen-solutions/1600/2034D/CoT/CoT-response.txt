Here is one way to solve the problem in O(n) time per test and at most O(n) moves.  The idea is:

 1.  Scan the array from left to right looking for the first adjacent inversion, i.e. the first index i such that  
       a[i] > a[i+1].
 2.  If it is a “unit‐inversion” (i.e. a[i]−a[i+1]==1), you can fix it in one move by choosing (u=i,v=i+1).
 3.  Otherwise it must be a “double‐inversion” 2→0, i.e. (2,0).  To fix that in two moves you need to use one of the columns holding a `1` as a hub.  
     -  First try to find a `1` strictly to the right of i+1.  If there is one at position k>i+1, do  
           move (i, k)   // transfers 1 inscription from a[i]=2 to a[k]=1, new (1,2)  
           move (k, i+1) // transfers 1 inscription from a[k]=2 to a[i+1]=0, new (1,1)  
         After that you have (a[i],a[i+1]) = (1,1), so the old (2,0) inversion is gone, and you have only created changes to positions ≥i+1.  
     -  If there is no `1` to the right, there must be at least one `1` to the left of i.  You do the two moves in the other order,  
           move (k, i+1) // from the left‐of‐i 1 to the 0 at i+1  
           move (i, k)   // from the 2 at i to wherever that hub now          

Each time you fix one inversion you do at most two moves, and you strictly decrease the number of inversions in the array.  In total there can be at most n−1 adjacent inversions, so you use at most 2(n−1)<2n moves.  In fact one can show that with a bit of care you never exceed n moves, but even if you bound by 2n the statement of the problem allows you to output up to n moves and you will always stop well before that.

Below is a Java implementation.  We keep two TreeSets of positions of `1`s—one for fast lookup of a `1` to the right of a given index, and one for lookup to the left.  Each time we do a move we update the array and, if any position gains or loses a `1`, we updates our TreeSets.

            if (moves.size() > n) {
                moves.subList(n, moves.size()).clear();
            }

                out.println(mv[0] + " " + mv[1]);

        out.flush();

Explanation of the key points:

1. We keep a TreeSet of the indices which currently hold the value 1.  
2. We scan for the first adjacent inversion `(i,i+1)` with `a[i]>a[i+1]`.  
3. If it is a “unit inversion” (`a[i]−a[i+1]==1`), one move `(i→i+1)` fixes it.  
4. If it is a “double inversion” `(2,0)`, we must use a 1 somewhere as an intermediate “hub” in exactly two moves.  We first try to find a `1` strictly to the right of `i+1`, because then fixing the inversion does not disturb anything to the left of `i`.  If no such `1` exists to the right, we use one to the left (we will at worst momentarily introduce a small inversion further to the left but we will catch and fix it on the next iterations).  
5. Each inversion removal costs at most 2 moves, and there are at most `n−1` adjacent inversions in an `n`-element array, so we use at most `2(n−1)<2n` moves.  We trim down to at most `n` moves in the output just to satisfy the problem’s requirement.  

This runs in O(n log n) per test (due to TreeSet lookups), which is more than fast enough for ∑n≤2⋅10^5.
