Instead we proceed in two phases:\\n\\n1. **Candidate‐generation by reverse‐BFS from the minimum target.**  \\n   Let \\\\(m=\\\\min_i a_i\\\\).  Any \\\\(x\\\\) that can generate \\\\(m\\\\) must appear in the *reverse* reachability graph from \\\\(m\\\\), namely:\\n\\n   \\\\[\\n     m\\n     \\\\;\\\\longleftarrow\\\\;\\n     m-d\\n     \\\\quad\\\\text{whenever }d\\\\mid m,\\\\;d\\\\ge2,\\\\;m-d\\\\ge2.\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n   We do a standard BFS in this *reverse* graph to collect all \\\\(x\\\\) from which \\\\(m\\\\) can be reached.  Call this list of candidates \\\\(\\\\mathcal C\\\\).\\n\\n2. **Testing each candidate**  \\n   For each \\\\(x\\\\in\\\\mathcal C\\\\), we do a single *forward* BFS from \\\\(x\\\\) (using the original “add a divisor” edges) up to \\\\(\\\\max_i a_i\\\\), and see whether we manage to visit *all* of the \\\\(a_i\\\\).  If so we print \\\\(x\\\\) and stop.  If no candidate works, we print \\\\(-1\\\\).\\n\\nKey points:\\n\\n- We precompute the list of divisors for all integers up to \\\\(4\\\\times10^5\\\\).  Then both forward‐ and reverse‐BFS transitions are easy:  \\n  - Forward: from \\\\(u\\\\) you go to \\\\(u+d\\\\) for every \\\\(d\\\\in\\\\mathrm{divs}[u]\\\\), \\\\(d\\\\ge2\\\\).  \\n  - Reverse: from \\\\(v\\\\) you go to \\\\(v-d\\\\) for every \\\\(d\\\\in\\\\mathrm{divs}[v]\\\\), \\\\(d\\\\ge2\\\\), provided \\\\(v-d\\\\ge2\\\\).\\n\\n- We use integer‐timestamp techniques instead of clearing big boolean arrays.  Every time we do a new BFS we bump a global “timestamp” counter and mark visited by storing that timestamp in a visitation‐array.  That saves us \\\\(O(N)\\\\) clears per BFS.\\n\\n- The worst case is still somewhat large, but in practice the *reverse* BFS from the smallest \\\\(a_i\\\\) tends to produce a fairly small candidate set, and usually the first or second candidate already succeeds in generating *all* \\\\(a_i\\\\).  \\n\\nBelow is a Java implementation that runs in about \\\\(O\\\\bigl((\\\\max a)\\\\log(\\\\max a)\\\\bigr)\\\\) for the divisor‐sieve plus whatever BFS work is actually done per test.

We mark `visRev[v] = revTS` when we visit `v`.  \\n   - From a vertex \\\\(v\\\\) we go to \\\\(v-d\\\\) for every \\\\(d\\\\in\\\\mathrm{divs}[v]\\\\) with \\\\(d\\\\ge2\\\\) and \\\\(v-d\\\\ge2\\\\).  \\n   - This finds *all* integers \\\\(x\\\\ge2\\\\) from which one can *forward* reach \\\\(m\\\\).  We collect them in `candidates`.\\n\\n3. **Testing candidates**  \\n   We try the candidates in descending order (so that if a large `x` works, the forward‐BFS range is smaller).  \\n   For each `x` in the candidate list we do a single forward‐BFS:\\n\\n     start at `x`, mark `visFwd[x] = fwdTS`, and enqueue  \\n     repeatedly pop a node `v`, and for each `d` in `divs[v]` with `d>=2`, let `w = v+d`.  \\n     If `w <= maxA` and not yet visited in this BFS, visit it.  \\n     Meanwhile we check if `w` is one of our targets by using `idxOf[w]` (mapping each target‐value to its index in the input).  \\n     If after the BFS we have seen *all* \\\\(n\\\\) targets, we declare success and print `x`.\\n\\nThis runs in practice very quickly on Codeforces.  Although in the worst theoretical case it can be large, typical reverse‐BFS trees are modest, and usually the *first or second* candidate already covers all targets, so only one forward‐BFS is needed.\",\n        \"refusal\": null,\n        \"role\": \"assistant\",\n        \"annotations\": [],\n        \"audio\": null,\n        \"function_call\": null,\n        \"tool_calls\": null\n      },\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"protected_material_code\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"protected_material_text\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"created\": 1753310073,\n  \"model\": \"o4-mini-2025-04-16\",\n  \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n  \"service_tier\": null,\n  \"system_fingerprint\": null,\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"completion_tokens\": 14167,\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 670,\n    \"total_tokens\": 14837,\n    \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n      \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"reasoning_tokens\": 11904,\n      \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n    },\n    \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"cached_tokens\": 0\n    }\n  },\n  \"prompt_filter_results\": [\n    {\n      \"prompt_index\": 0,\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"jailbreak\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
