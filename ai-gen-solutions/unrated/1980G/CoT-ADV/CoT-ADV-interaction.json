Yasya and the Mysterious Tree\n\ntime limit per test2.5 seconds\n\nmemory limit per test512 megabytes\n\nYasya was walking in the forest and accidentally found a tree with n\n\n vertices. A tree is a connected undirected graph with no cycles.\n\n\n\nNext to the tree, the girl found an ancient manuscript with m\n\n queries written on it. The queries can be of two types.\n\n\n\nThe first type of query is described by the integer y\n\n. The weight of each edge in the tree is replaced by the bitwise exclusive OR of the weight of that edge and the integer y\n\n.\n\n\n\nThe second type is described by the vertex v\n\n and the integer x\n\n. Yasya chooses a vertex u\n\n (1≤u≤n\n\n, u≠v\n\n) and mentally draws a bidirectional edge of weight x\n\n from v\n\n to u\n\n in the tree.\n\n\n\nThen Yasya finds a simple cycle in the resulting graph and calculates the bitwise exclusive OR of all the edges in it. She wants to choose a vertex u\n\n such that the calculated value is maximum. This calculated value will be the answer to the query. It can be shown that such a cycle exists and is unique under the given constraints (independent of the choice of u\n\n). If an edge between v\n\n and u\n\n already existed, a simple cycle is the path v→u→v\n\n.\n\n\n\nNote that the second type of query is performed mentally, meaning the tree does not change in any way after it.\n\n\n\nHelp Yasya answer all the queries.\n\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t\n\n (1≤t≤104\n\n) — the number of test cases.\n\n\n\nThe descriptions of the test cases follow.\n\n\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers n\n\n, m\n\n (2≤n≤2⋅105\n\n, 1≤m≤2⋅105\n\n) — the number of vertices in the tree and the number of queries.\n\n\n\nThe next n−1\n\n lines of each test case contain three integers v\n\n, u\n\n, w\n\n (1≤v,u≤n\n\n, 1≤w≤109\n\n) — the ends of some edge in the tree and its weight.\n\n\n\nIt is guaranteed that the given set of edges forms a tree.\n\n\n\nThe next m\n\n lines of each test case describe the queries:\n\n\n\n^ y\n\n (1≤y≤109\n\n) — parameter of the first type query;\n\n? v\n\n x\n\n (1≤v≤n\n\n, 1≤x≤109\n\n) — parameters of the second type query.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n\n\n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105\n\n. The same is guaranteed for m\n\n.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output the answers to the queries of the second type.\n\n\n\nExamples\n\nInputCopy\n\n2\n\n3 7\n\n1 2 1\n\n3 1 8\n\n^ 5\n\n? 2 9\n\n^ 1\n\n? 1 10\n\n^ 6\n\n? 3 1\n\n? 2 9\n\n5 6\n\n1 2 777\n\n3 2 2812\n\n4 1 16\n\n5 3 1000000000\n\n^ 4\n\n? 3 123\n\n? 5 1000000000\n\n^ 1000000000\n\n? 1 908070\n\n? 2 1\n\nOutputCopy\n\n13 15 11 10 \n\n1000000127 2812 999756331 999999756 \n\nInputCopy\n\n3\n\n8 4\n\n8 6 3\n\n6 3 4\n\n2 5 4\n\n7 6 2\n\n7 1 10\n\n4 1 4\n\n5 1 2\n\n^ 4\n\n^ 7\n\n? 7 8\n\n? 4 10\n\n5 6\n\n3 1 4\n\n2 3 9\n\n4 3 6\n\n5 2 10\n\n? 5 7\n\n^ 1\n\n^ 8\n\n? 4 10\n\n? 1 9\n\n? 3 6\n\n4 2\n\n2 1 4\n\n4 3 5\n\n2 3 4\n\n^ 13\n\n? 1 10\n\nOutputCopy\n\n14 13 \n\n13 8 11 11 \n\n10 \n\n---\n\nYou are a competitive programming assistant solving Codeforces problems using Java. First, carefully read and restate the problem in your own words to ensure full understanding. Identify the input and output formats, list the constraints, and consider any edge cases that might affect the logic. Next, determine which algorithmic pattern the problem fits best—such as greedy, binary search, two pointers, dynamic programming, or graph traversal—and briefly explain why that pattern applies. Then, plan your solution step by step, describing the key ideas, data structures, or mathematical insights you’ll use. Once your plan is clear, write a clean and fully working Java program. Use import java.util.*; and include a Main class with a main method, using Scanner or BufferedReader for input depending on the constraints. Add comments to explain important logic in the code. After coding, walk through a sample input manually to show how your solution works in practice. Finally, analyze the time and space complexity of your approach using Big-O notation, justifying your answer. Think step by step and only write code once the logic is sound and complete."

We must process \\\\(m\\\\) queries of two types:\\n\\n1. **“^ y”**  \\n   Bitwise-XOR every tree‐edge’s weight with \\\\(y\\\\).  This update is *persistent*: future queries see the updated weights.\\n\\n2. **“? v x”**  \\n   Mental operation: pick a different vertex \\\\(u\\\\neq v\\\\), add an edge of weight \\\\(x\\\\) between \\\\(v\\\\) and \\\\(u\\\\), form the unique simple cycle, and compute the XOR of all edge‐weights along that cycle.  We want to *maximize* that cycle‐XOR over our choice of \\\\(u\\\\).  Output that maximum.  (The tree itself is **not** actually modified.)\\n\\nWe must answer all “?” queries in the order given.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Key Observations**\\n\\n1.  After a sequence of type‐1 updates (“\\\\(^\\\\,y\\\\)”), each original tree‐edge of original weight \\\\(w\\\\) has current weight\\n   \\\\[\\n     w' \\\\;=\\\\; w \\\\xor Y,\\n   \\\\]\\n   where \\\\(Y\\\\) is the cumulative XOR of all \\\\(y\\\\)-values seen so far.\\n\\n2.  Suppose we fix a query “? \\\\(v,x\\\\)”.  We attach a new edge \\\\((v,u)\\\\) of weight \\\\(x\\\\).  The resulting cycle is  \\n   \\\\[\\n     v \\\\;\\\\to\\\\;\\\\text{tree‐path}\\\\;\\\\to\\\\;u \\\\;\\\\to\\\\;(u\\\\!,v)\\\\;\\\\to\\\\;v.\\n   \\\\]\\n   The XOR of all its edge‐weights is\\n   \\\\[\\n     \\\\bigl(\\\\text{XOR of weights along tree‐path }v\\\\to u\\\\bigr)\\\\;\\\\xor\\\\; x.\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n3.  Let us root the tree at node \\\\(1\\\\).  Precompute for each node \\\\(u\\\\):\\n   - `A[u] = XOR of original edge‐weights along the path 1→u`.  \\n   - `parity[u] = (distance in edges from 1 to u) mod 2`, i.e.\\\\ depth parity.\\n\\n   Then the original XOR along \\\\(v\\\\to u\\\\) is\\n   \\\\[\\n     A[v]\\\\;\\\\xor\\\\;A[u].\\n   \\\\]\\n   Under the global edge‐XOR by \\\\(Y\\\\), each edge weight \\\\(w_i\\\\) becomes \\\\(w_i \\\\xor Y\\\\), so a length-\\\\(k\\\\) path’s XOR becomes\\n   \\\\[\\n     (A[v]\\\\xor A[u]) \\\\;\\\\xor\\\\; (Y\\\\;\\\\times\\\\;(k\\\\bmod2))\\n     \\\\;=\\\\;\\n     A[v]\\\\xor A[u]\\\\xor\\n     \\\\begin{cases}\\n       0,& k\\\\text{ even}\\\\\\\\\\n       Y,& k\\\\text{ odd}\\n     \\\\end{cases}.\\n   \\\\]\\n   But the parity \\\\(k\\\\bmod2\\\\) is exactly\\n   \\\\(\\\\bigl(parity[v]\\\\oplus parity[u]\\\\bigr)\\\\).\\n\\n4.  So for a query “? \\\\(v,x\\\\)”, the possible cycle XOR is\\n   \\\\[\\n     \\\\bigl(A[v]\\\\xor A[u]\\\\xor (\\\\,parity[v]\\\\oplus parity[u]\\\\,)\\\\cdot Y\\\\bigr)\\\\;\\\\xor\\\\;x.\\n   \\\\]\\n   We must maximize that over all \\\\(u\\\\neq v\\\\).  Rewrite it as two cases:\\n   - **Case 0** (\\\\(parity[u]=parity[v]\\\\)):  \\n     cycle‐XOR \\\\(=\\\\bigl(A[v]\\\\xor A[u]\\\\bigr)\\\\xor x\\\\).\\n   - **Case 1** (\\\\(parity[u]\\\\neq parity[v]\\\\)):  \\n     cycle‐XOR \\\\(=\\\\bigl(A[v]\\\\xor A[u]\\\\xor Y\\\\bigr)\\\\xor x\\\\).\\n\\n5.  Maximizing \\\\((A[v]\\\\xor A[u])\\\\xor x\\\\) over \\\\(u\\\\) of the same parity is the same as building a bit‐trie (prefix‐trie of bits) over  \\n   \\\\(\\\\{\\\\,A[u]\\\\mid parity[u]=p\\\\}\\\\)  \\n   and querying “best XOR against the pattern \\\\((A[v]\\\\xor x)\\\\).”  Likewise for the opposite‐parity set with the pattern \\\\((A[v]\\\\xor Y\\\\xor x)\\\\).\\n\\n6.  **Important**: We must never allow \\\\(u=v\\\\).  Inserting \\\\(A[v]\\\\) into the same‐parity trie would allow \\\\(u=v\\\\) and give a fake answer \\\\((0)\\\\xor x = x\\\\).  Hence, for each “?” query, we **temporarily remove** \\\\(A[v]\\\\) from the trie of its own parity, do our two max‐XOR queries, then re‐insert \\\\(A[v]\\\\).\\n\\n7.  All operations (one removal, one reinsertion, two max‐XOR‐queries) cost \\\\(O(\\\\log W)\\\\), with \\\\(W\\\\le10^9\\\\) so \\\\(\\\\log W\\\\approx30\\\\).  Over up to \\\\(2\\\\times10^5\\\\) queries total, this is about \\\\(O(200000\\\\times60)\\\\approx12\\\\) million trie‐steps—comfortably fast in Java with good I/O.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Solution Outline**\\n\\n1. Read \\\\(t\\\\) (number of test cases).\\n2. For each test:\\n   a. Read \\\\(n,m\\\\).  \\n   b. Read the \\\\(n-1\\\\) edges; build an adjacency list.  \\n   c. BFS from node 1, computing:\\n      - `A[u] =` XOR of original weights along 1→u.\\n      - `parity[u] =` depth\\\\(\\\\bmod2\\\\).\\n   d. Build two bit‐tries (`root[0]` and `root[1]`), one per parity.  Insert every `A[u]` into the trie corresponding to `parity[u]`.\\n   e. Maintain a running `Y=0`.  Process queries:\\n      - If “^ y”: do `Y ^= y`.\\n      - If “? v x”:\\n         i. Remove `A[v]` from `trie[parity[v]]`.\\n         ii. Let  \\n            \\\\[\\n              val0 = A[v]\\\\xor x,\\\\quad\\n              val1 = A[v]\\\\xor Y \\\\xor x.\\n            \\\\]\\n            - If trie[parity[v]] is nonempty, query its best‐XOR with `val0`.  Otherwise set that candidate to \\\\(-1\\\\).\\n            - Query trie[parity[v]^1] with `val1`.\\n         iii. The answer is the maximum of the two candidates.  Print it.\\n         iv. Re‐insert `A[v]` into `trie[parity[v]]`.\\n   f. After finishing, clear out all used trie‐nodes so the next test can reuse the same global arrays.\\n\\n3. Done.\\n\\nTime complexity per test is \\\\(O((n+m)\\\\times \\\\log W)\\\\).  Since \\\\(\\\\sum n,\\\\sum m \\\\le2\\\\times10^5\\\\), total under \\\\(10^7\\\\)–\\\\(10^8\\\\) operations.\\n\\n---\\n\\n```java\\nimport java.io.*;\\nimport java.util.*;\\n\\npublic class Main {\\n    static final int MAXNODE = 6500000;  // ~ 2e5 * 31 + a little extra\\n    static int[][] nxt = new int[MAXNODE][2];\\n    static int[] cnt = new int[MAXNODE];\\n    static int nextNode;\\n    static int[] root = new int[2];\\n\\n    // Insert val into trie #t (t = 0 or 1)\\n    static void trieInsert(int t, int val) {\\n        int cur = root[t];\\n        cnt[cur]++;\\n        for (int b = 30; b >= 0; b--) {\\n            int bit = (val >> b) & 1;\\n            if (nxt[cur][bit] == 0) {\\n                nxt[cur][bit] = nextNode++;\\n            }\\n            cur = nxt[cur][bit];\\n            cnt[cur]++;\\n        }\\n    }\\n\\n    // Remove val from trie #t\\n    static void trieRemove(int t, int val) {\\n        int cur = root[t];\\n        cnt[cur]--;\\n        for (int b = 30; b >= 0; b--) {\\n            int bit = (val >> b) & 1;\\n            cur = nxt[cur][bit];\\n            cnt[cur]--;\\n        }\\n    }\\n\\n    // Query maximum (val XOR stored) in trie #t; returns -1 if empty\\n    static int trieQuery(int t, int val) {\\n        int cur = root[t];\\n        if (cnt[cur] == 0) return -1;\\n        int res = 0;\\n        for (int b = 30; b >= 0; b--) {\\n            int bit = (val >> b) & 1;\\n            // prefer opposite branch if nonempty\\n            int opp = nxt[cur][bit ^ 1];\\n            if (opp != 0 && cnt[opp] > 0) {\\n                res |= (1 << b);\\n                cur = opp;\\n            } else {\\n                cur = nxt[cur][bit];\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return res;\\n    }\\n\\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\\n        FastReader in = new FastReader();\\n        StringBuilder output = new StringBuilder();\\n        int T = in.nextInt();\\n        while (T-- > 0) {\\n            int n = in.nextInt(), m = in.nextInt();\\n            List<int[]>[] adj = new ArrayList[n+1];\\n            for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\\n                adj[i] = new ArrayList<>();\\n            }\\n            for (int i = 0; i < n-1; i++) {\\n                int u = in.nextInt();\\n                int v = in.nextInt();\\n                int w = in.nextInt();\\n                adj[u].add(new int[]{v, w});\\n                adj[v].add(new int[]{u, w});\\n            }\\n            // BFS to compute A[u] and parity[u]\\n            int[] A = new int[n+1];\\n            int[] parity = new int[n+1];\\n            boolean[] seen = new boolean[n+1];\\n            Deque<Integer> dq = new ArrayDeque<>();\\n            dq.add(1); seen[1] = true;\\n            A[1] = 0; parity[1] = 0;\\n            while (!dq.isEmpty()) {\\n                int u = dq.poll();\\n                for (int[] e : adj[u]) {\\n                    int v = e[0], w = e[1];\\n                    if (!seen[v]) {\\n                        seen[v] = true;\\n                        parity[v] = parity[u] ^ 1;\\n                        A[v] = A[u] ^ w;\\n                        dq.add(v);\\n                    }\\n                }\\n            }\\n\\n            // Initialize our 2 tries\\n            nextNode = 2;\\n            root[0] = 0; root[1] = 1;\\n            cnt[0] = cnt[1] = 0;\\n            nxt[0][0] = nxt[0][1] = 0;\\n            nxt[1][0] = nxt[1][1] = 0;\\n\\n            // Insert each A[u] into the appropriate parity-trie\\n            for (int u = 1; u <= n; u++) {\\n                trieInsert(parity[u], A[u]);\\n            }\\n\\n            int Y = 0;  // cumulative XOR from \\\"^ y\\\" updates\\n            for (int qi = 0; qi < m; qi++) {\\n                char c = in.next().charAt(0);\\n                if (c == '^') {\\n                    int y = in.nextInt();\\n                    Y ^= y;\\n                } else {\\n                    // query \\\"?

v x” Query**  \\n   - The XOR for cycle formed by adding `(v,u)` with weight `x` is  \\n     \\\\(\\\\bigl(\\\\text{pathXOR}(v,u)\\\\bigr)\\\\oplus x\\\\).  \\n   - Under the global XOR‐with‐`Y`, the tree‐path XOR from `v` to `u` is\\n     \\\\[\\n       A[v]\\\\oplus A[u]\\\\oplus\\n       \\\\bigl((parity[v]\\\\oplus parity[u])\\\\times Y\\\\bigr).\\n     \\\\]\\n   - Splitting nodes `u` into **same parity** or **opposite parity** relative to `v`, we get two expressions:\\n     1. Same parity: \\\\((A[v]\\\\oplus A[u])\\\\oplus x\\\\).\\n     2. Opposite parity: \\\\((A[v]\\\\oplus A[u]\\\\oplus Y)\\\\oplus x\\\\).\\n   - To *maximize* an XOR of the form `(K ⊕ A[u])`, a classic trick is to keep a bit‐trie of all `A[u]` in that parity set and query it with `K`.  Here\\n     - for same parity: `K = A[v] ⊕ x`,\\n     - for opposite parity: `K = A[v] ⊕ Y ⊕ x`.\\n   - **Important**: we must *not* allow the choice `u=v`.  Hence we **temporarily remove** `A[v]` from its own–parity trie, do both queries, then re‐insert `A[v]`.\\n\\n4. **Complexities**  \\n   - **Preprocessing BFS**: \\\\(O(n)\\\\).\\n   - **Building tries**: \\\\(O(n \\\\times \\\\log W)\\\\) with \\\\(W\\\\le10^9\\\\).\\n   - **Each “?” query**: Removal \\\\((O(\\\\log W))\\\\), two trie‐queries \\\\((2\\\\times O(\\\\log W))\\\\), and re‐insertion \\\\((O(\\\\log W))\\\\).
