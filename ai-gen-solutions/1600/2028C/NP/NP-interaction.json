Alice's Adventures in Cutting Cake\n\ntime limit per test2 seconds\n\nmemory limit per test256 megabytes\n\nAlice is at the Mad Hatter's tea party! There is a long sheet cake made up of n\n\n sections with tastiness values a1,a2,…,an\n\n. There are m\n\n creatures at the tea party, excluding Alice.\n\n\n\nAlice will cut the cake into m+1\n\n pieces. Formally, she will partition the cake into m+1\n\n subarrays, where each subarray consists of some number of adjacent sections. The tastiness of a piece is the sum of tastiness of its sections. Afterwards, she will divvy these m+1\n\n pieces up among the m\n\n creatures and herself (her piece can be empty). However, each of the m\n\n creatures will only be happy when the tastiness of its piece is v\n\n or more.\n\n\n\nAlice wants to make sure every creature is happy. Limited by this condition, she also wants to maximize the tastiness of her own piece. Can you help Alice find the maximum tastiness her piece can have? If there is no way to make sure every creature is happy, output −1\n\n.\n\n\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t\n\n (1≤t≤104\n\n). The description of the test cases follows.\n\n\n\nThe first line of each test case contains three integers n,m,v\n\n (1≤m≤n≤2⋅105\n\n; 1≤v≤109\n\n) — the number of sections, the number of creatures, and the creatures' minimum requirement for tastiness, respectively.\n\n\n\nThe next line contains n\n\n space separated integers a1,a2,…,an\n\n (1≤ai≤109\n\n) — the tastinesses of the sections.\n\n\n\nThe sum of n\n\n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105\n\n.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output the maximum tastiness Alice can achieve for her piece, or −1\n\n if there is no way to make sure every creature is happy.\n\n\n\nExample\n\nInputCopy\n\n7\n\n6 2 1\n\n1 1 10 1 1 10\n\n6 2 2\n\n1 1 10 1 1 10\n\n6 2 3\n\n1 1 10 1 1 10\n\n6 2 10\n\n1 1 10 1 1 10\n\n6 2 11\n\n1 1 10 1 1 10\n\n6 2 12\n\n1 1 10 1 1 10\n\n6 2 12\n\n1 1 1 1 10 10\n\nOutputCopy\n\n22\n\n12\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n0\n\n-1\n\nNote\n\nFor the first test case, Alice can give the first and second section as their own pieces, and then take the remaining 10+1+1+10=22\n\n tastiness for herself. We can show that she cannot do any better.\n\n\n\nFor the second test case, Alice could give the first and second section as one piece, and the sixth section as one piece. She can then take the remaining 10+1+1=12\n\n tastiness for herself. We can show that she cannot do any better.\n\n\n\nFor the seventh test case, Alice cannot give each creature a piece of at least 12\n\n tastiness.\n\n---\n\nUse Java."

Concretely, if Alice’s piece is the subarray\\n\\n```\\n[t .. s]\\n```\\n\\nthen the creatures’ pieces partition the prefix `[1..t−1]` into some number `k` of valid pieces (each ≥v), and partition the suffix `[s+1 .. n]` into the remaining `m−k` valid pieces (each ≥v).  We only need **at least** `m` such pieces total, and then we can discard any extra.  Thus the condition is\\n\\n```\\n( max # of valid segments in [1..t−1] )  +  ( max # of valid segments in [s+1..n] )  ≥ m.\\n```\\n\\nDefine two arrays by a simple greedy:\\n\\n  • `pref[i]` = maximum number of disjoint segments with sum ≥v in the prefix `a[1..i]`.  \\n    We get this by a “take the earliest finishing segment” scan from left to right:\\n      accumulate a running sum; once it reaches ≥v, we increment a counter, reset sum=0, and continue.\\n\\n  • `suff[i]` = maximum number of disjoint segments with sum ≥v in the suffix `a[i..n]`.\\n    Analogously from right to left.\\n\\nBoth `pref[i]` and `suff[i]` are automatically optimal for maximizing the count of ≥v‐segments (the classic “interval‐scheduling” greedy for earliest finish).\\n\\nLet\\n```\\nP[i] = a[1] + a[2] + … + a[i]   (prefix sums, with P[0]=0).\\n```\\n\\nWe want to choose an interval `[t..s]` to be Alice’s.  Then\\n\\n- the creatures must get at least `m` valid segments overall, i.e.\\n  ```\\n  pref[t−1] + suff[s+1] ≥ m.\\n  ```\\n- Alice’s sum is\\n  ```\\n  A = P[s] − P[t−1].\\n  ```\\n\\nWe now rewrite indices more conveniently.  Let\\n```\\nL = t−1   (so 0 ≤ L ≤ n),\\nR = s+1   (so 1 ≤ R ≤ n+1),\\n```\\nand we require `L < R`.  The condition becomes\\n\\n  (1)  `pref[L] + suff[R] ≥ m`\\n\\n  Alice’s sum =  `P[R−1] − P[L]`.\\n\\nWe must maximize that over all `0 ≤ L < R ≤ n+1` satisfying (1).\\n\\nBecause `a[i] ≥ 1` the prefix sums are strictly increasing, so for each `R` we want the smallest possible `P[L]` among those `L < R` with\\n```\\npref[L] ≥ m − suff[R].\\n```\\nLet\\n```\\nneed(R) = m − suff[R].\\n```\\nIf `need(R) ≤ 0`, that means the right side alone gives ≥m segments, so any `L<R` is OK (i.e. `pref[L] ≥ 0` always); if `need(R) > m`, no `L` can have `pref[L]` that large, so `R` is impossible.\\n\\nSo for each `R=1..n+1`:\\n\\n1. Compute `need = m − suff[R]`.\\n2. If `0 ≤ need ≤ m`, we look for\\n   ```\\n   minP = min{ P[L] : 0 ≤ L < R  and  pref[L] ≥ need }.\\n   ```\\n   Then candidate answer = `P[R−1] − minP`.\\n3. We keep a data structure on the fly that, as we advance `R` from 1 up to `n+1`, has already “inserted” all `L=0,1,…,R−2` (so that the condition `L < R` is enforced), keyed by `pref[L]`, value `P[L]`, and supports:\\n   - point‐update at index `p = pref[L]` with value `P[L]`,\\n   - range‐minimum‐query over `[need..m]`.\\n\\nWe clamp all `pref[i]` and `suff[i]` to at most `m` (anything above `m` behaves like `m`, since we only care up to `m`).\\n\\nA standard segment‐tree (or a Fenwick with min‐over‐suffix by index‐reversal trick) handles updates in O(log m) and queries in O(log m).  Since `n` and total over all test‐cases is ≤2⋅10^5, the total cost is O(n log n), which is fine.\\n\\nIf we never find a valid `(L,R)` pair, we output −1; otherwise we output the maximum found.  Note also that an empty piece for Alice (sum=0) is allowed, so a final answer of 0 can be valid when no positive piece is possible but the creatures can still be made happy.\\n\\n---\\n\\n```java\\nimport java.io.*;\\nimport java.util.*;\\n\\npublic class Main {\\n    static final long INF = (long)4e18;\\n\\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\\n        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));\\n        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\\n        int t = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine().trim());\\n        while (t-- > 0) {\\n            StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\\n            int n = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\\n            int m = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\\n            long v = Long.parseLong(st.nextToken());\\n\\n            long[] a = new long[n+1];\\n            st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\\n            for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\\n                a[i] = Long.parseLong(st.nextToken());\\n            }\\n\\n            // 1) Compute pref[i] = max # of disjoint segments with sum >= v in a[1..i]\\n            int[] pref = new int[n+1];\\n            {\\n                long sum = 0;\\n                int cnt = 0;\\n                for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\\n                    sum += a[i];\\n                    if (sum >= v) {\\n                        cnt++;\\n                        sum = 0;\\n                    }\\n                    // clamp to m (we never need more than m)\\n                    pref[i] = cnt > m ?
