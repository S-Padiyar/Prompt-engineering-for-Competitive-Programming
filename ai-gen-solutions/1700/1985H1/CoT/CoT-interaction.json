Maximize the Largest Component (Easy Version)\n\ntime limit per test2 seconds\n\nmemory limit per test512 megabytes\n\nEasy and hard versions are actually different problems, so read statements of both problems completely and carefully. The only difference between the two versions is the operation.\n\n\n\nAlex has a grid with n\n\n rows and m\n\n columns consisting of '.' and '#' characters. A set of '#' cells forms a connected component if from any cell in this set, it is possible to reach any other cell in this set by only moving to another cell in the set that shares a common side. The size of a connected component is the number of cells in the set.\n\n\n\nIn one operation, Alex selects any row r\n\n (1≤r≤n\n\n) or any column c\n\n (1≤c≤m\n\n), then sets every cell in row r\n\n or column c\n\n to be '#'. Help Alex find the maximum possible size of the largest connected component of '#' cells that he can achieve after performing the operation at most once.\n\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer t\n\n (1≤t≤104\n\n) — the number of test cases.\n\n\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers n\n\n and m\n\n (1≤n⋅m≤106\n\n) — the number of rows and columns of the grid.\n\n\n\nThe next n\n\n lines each contain m\n\n characters.

Connected components of `#`‐cells are 4‐connected (up/down/left/right).  We may perform _at most one_ operation: pick one entire row or one entire column and turn _all_ its cells into `#`.  We want the maximum size of the largest connected component of `#` that can result.\\n\\nLet us outline the steps:\\n\\n1. **Label the initial connected components.**\\n\\n   We run a BFS/DFS over the grid to label each `#`‐cell with a component ID and compute the size of each component.  We store:\\n\\n   - `id[k]` = the component ID of cell \\\\(k\\\\) (flattened index \\\\(k=i\\\\cdot m + j\\\\)), or -1 if it is `.`.\\n   - `compSize[c]` = the size (number of cells) of component \\\\(c\\\\).\\n\\n   We also record\\n   - `origRowCount[r]` = how many `#` are in row \\\\(r\\\\) originally,\\n   - `origColCount[c]` = how many `#` are in column \\\\(c\\\\) originally.\\n\\n   Let `baseMax` = the size of the largest component before any operation.\\n\\n2. **Try flipping each row.**\\n\\n   When we flip row \\\\(r\\\\), all its \\\\(m\\\\) cells become `#`.  This newly‐filled row will connect all original components that “touch” that row, either\\n\\n   - because they already had a `#` in row \\\\(r\\\\), or\\n   - because they have a `#` just above or just below row \\\\(r\\\\).\\n\\n   Let \\\\(S_r\\\\) be the set of _distinct_ component IDs adjacent to row \\\\(r\\\\).  The size of the new merged component formed by that flip is\\n   \\\\[\\n     \\\\biggl(\\\\sum_{c\\\\in S_r}\\\\text{compSize}[c]\\\\biggr)\\n     \\\\;+\\\\;\\\\bigl(m - \\\\text{origRowCount}[r]\\\\bigr),\\n   \\\\]\\n   because \\\\(m - \\\\text{origRowCount}[r]\\\\) is exactly how many new `#`‐cells appear in that row (cells that were `.` turn into `#`).\\n\\n   We sweep all rows and keep track of the maximum over those.\\n\\n3. **Try flipping each column.**\\n\\n   Symmetrically, flipping column \\\\(c\\\\) sets all \\\\(n\\\\) cells of column \\\\(c\\\\) to `#`.  It merges all components that had a `#` in column \\\\(c\\\\) or immediately to the left/right of that column.  If \\\\(T_c\\\\) is the set of those component IDs, the resulting size is\\n\\n   \\\\[\\n     \\\\biggl(\\\\sum_{d\\\\in T_c}\\\\text{compSize}[d]\\\\biggr)\\n     \\\\;+\\\\;\\\\bigl(n - \\\\text{origColCount}[c]\\\\bigr).\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n   We sweep all columns and keep track of the maximum.\\n\\n4. **Answer.**\\n\\n   The final answer is the maximum among\\n   \\\\[\\n     \\\\text{baseMax},\\\\quad\\n     \\\\max_{r}(\\\\text{row‐flip result for }r),\\\\quad\\n     \\\\max_{c}(\\\\text{col‐flip result for }c).\\n   \\\\]\\n\\nAll of the steps run in \\\\(O(nm)\\\\) per test case (labelling the components, then scanning rows and columns, each scan is \\\\(O(nm)\\\\) overall).

We run BFS from every unvisited `#` cell, mark all reachable `#` cells with the same component ID, and record that component’s size.\\n\\n2. **Row‐flip / Column‐flip Computation**  \\n   When we flip a row \\\\(r\\\\),\\n\\n   - It will contain \\\\(m\\\\) `#` cells after the flip.\\n   - Some of those cells were originally `#` and already belonged to some components.\\n   - Some are brand‐new `#` (originally `.` in that row).\\n\\n   All original components that touch that row either from within the row itself, or from the row just above, or the row just below, will become one big merged component.  We sum the sizes of those _distinct_ components, then add the number of _new_ `#` cells in the row, which is\\n   \\\\[\\n     m - (\\\\text{how many `#` were originally in row }r).\\n   \\\\]\\n   We do the same idea for each column.\\n\\n3. **Complexities**  \\n   - Labelling components via BFS is \\\\(O(nm)\\\\).  \\n   - Scanning all rows takes \\\\(O(n\\\\,m)\\\\), scanning all columns another \\\\(O(n\\\\,m)\\\\).  \\n   Total per test case is \\\\(O(nm)\\\\).  Since \\\\(\\\\sum n\\\\,m \\\\le 10^6\\\\) over all tests, this runs comfortably in time.\",\n        \"refusal\": null,\n        \"role\": \"assistant\",\n        \"annotations\": [],\n        \"audio\": null,\n        \"function_call\": null,\n        \"tool_calls\": null\n      },\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"protected_material_code\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": true,\n          \"citation\": {\n            \"URL\": \"https://github.com/incendi0/Lumos/tree/88f0429f6ba817759e947f855dfad1cfde4df271/leetcode%2Fleetcode%E7%AC%AC164%E5%9C%BA%E5%91%A8%E8%B5%9B.md\",\n            \"license\": \"NOASSERTION\"\n          }\n        },\n        \"protected_material_text\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"created\": 1753309416,\n  \"model\": \"o4-mini-2025-04-16\",\n  \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n  \"service_tier\": null,\n  \"system_fingerprint\": null,\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"completion_tokens\": 8885,\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 630,\n    \"total_tokens\": 9515,\n    \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n      \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"reasoning_tokens\": 6144,\n      \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n    },\n    \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"cached_tokens\": 0\n    }\n  },\n  \"prompt_filter_results\": [\n    {\n      \"prompt_index\": 0,\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"jailbreak\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
