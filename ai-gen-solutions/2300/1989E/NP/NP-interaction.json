From \\\\(a\\\\) we form an array \\\\(b\\\\) of the same length by\\n\\\\[\\n  b_i \\\\;=\\\\;\\\\min_{\\\\substack{1\\\\le j\\\\le n\\\\\\\\a_j\\\\ne a_i}}|i-j|\\\\;,\\n\\\\]\\ni.e.\\\\ \\\\(b_i\\\\) is the distance from position \\\\(i\\\\) to the nearest index where \\\\(a\\\\) has a _different_ color.  \\n\\nWe want to know _how many distinct arrays_ \\\\(b\\\\) one can get in this way, as \\\\(a\\\\) ranges over all length‐\\\\(n\\\\) arrays using exactly the \\\\(k\\\\) colors, modulo \\\\(998244353\\\\).\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 1.  Groups and “break‐bits”\\n\\nObserve that \\\\(a\\\\) breaks up into _maximal monochromatic runs_ (often called “groups”).  For example\\n\\\\[\\n   a = [\\\\,1,1,2,3,3,3,3,1\\\\,]\\n   \\\\quad\\\\Longrightarrow\\\\quad\\n   \\\\underbrace{[1,1]}_{G_1},\\\\;\\\\underbrace{[2]}_{G_2},\\\\;\\n   \\\\underbrace{[3,3,3,3]}_{G_3},\\\\;\\\\underbrace{[1]}_{G_4}.\\n\\\\]\\nEach run \\\\(G_i\\\\) has some length \\\\(L_i\\\\), and these lengths form a _composition_ of \\\\(n\\\\).\\n  \\nEquivalently, one can encode a composition \\\\(L_1+\\\\cdots+L_m=n\\\\) by a binary “break‐array” \\\\(b_1,\\\\dots,b_{n-1}\\\\), where\\n\\\\[\\n   b_j = \\n   \\\\begin{cases}\\n     1, & \\\\text{if there is a “break” (i.e.\\\\ a color‐change) between positions }j\\\\text{ and }j+1,\\\\\\\\\\n     0, & \\\\text{otherwise.}\\n   \\\\end{cases}\\n\\\\]\\nThen a run of \\\\(r\\\\) zeros preceded and followed by ones corresponds to a group of size \\\\(r+1\\\\), etc.  \\n \\nWhen you build \\\\(b\\\\)-values (the distance‐to‐nearest‐different), each interior group of length \\\\(L\\\\ge3\\\\) _uniquely_ creates a palindromic “hill” \\n\\\\[\\n   1,2,3,\\\\dots,L-1,L,L-1,\\\\dots,2,1,\\n\\\\]\\nand the two end‐groups create a strictly descending (or ascending) slope.  That shows that if an interior group has length \\\\(\\\\ge3\\\\), the resulting piece of \\\\(b\\\\) cannot coincide with any other way of partitioning.  However there is exactly one subtle _ambiguity_:\\n\\n-  An interior group of length \\\\(2\\\\) produces the segment\\n   \\\\[\\n     [1,\\\\,1],\\n   \\\\]\\n   which is _identical_ (as a list of two 1’s) to what you would get from _two_ consecutive interior groups each of length 1.  In effect\\n   \\\\[\\n     \\\\dots,\\\\,1,2,1,\\\\,\\\\dots\\n     \\\\quad\\\\longmapsto\\\\quad\\n     \\\\dots,\\\\,1,1,\\\\,1,\\\\,\\\\dots\\n   \\\\]\\n   when one forgets that it might have been “two 1’s vs. one 2 vs.\\\\ two 1’s.”  \\n\\nIt turns out that \\\\emph{every} distinct \\\\(b\\\\)-array in the problem comes from exactly one way of chopping \\\\(n\\\\) into runs so that \\\\emph{no interior group has length 2}.  (Whenever a composition would have given an interior group of length 2, you instead replace it by two groups of length 1, and this does \\\\emph{not} change the \\\\(b\\\\)-array.)\\n\\nHence counting \\\\emph{distinct} \\\\(b\\\\)-arrays is equivalent to counting all binary break‐strings\\n\\\\[\\n   b_1,b_2,\\\\dots,b_{n-1}\\n   \\\\quad\\\\text{(each }b_j\\\\in\\\\{0,1\\\\})\\n\\\\]\\nsubject to:\\n\\n1.  **Exactly \\\\(k\\\\) colors appear** translates to “the number of breaks must be at least \\\\(k-1\\\\),” because \\\\(m\\\\) runs means \\\\(m-1\\\\) breaks, and we need \\\\(m\\\\ge k\\\\).\\n2.  **No interior group of length 2** translates to “\\\\(\\\\mathbf{101}\\\\) never occurs at an \\\\emph{interior} 0.”  101 indicates a single 0 surrounded by 1’s, i.e.\\\\ a run of length 2 if it were interior.  We must forbid 101 around indices \\\\(2,3,\\\\dots,n-2\\\\), but allow it at the very ends if it occurs there (since that corresponds to a first‐ or last‐group of size 2, which is perfectly fine).\\n\\nThus the cleanest direct approach is a small‐state **DP** on the break‐string, forbidding the pattern 101 \\\\emph{only} when it occurs fully in positions \\\\(2\\\\dots n-2\\\\).\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 2.  The DP\\n\\nLet us attach sentinels \\\\(b_0=1\\\\), \\\\(b_n=1\\\\).  We will step from \\\\(i=1\\\\) up to \\\\(i=n\\\\), deciding each bit \\\\(b_i\\\\).  (The bits \\\\(b_1,\\\\dots,b_{n-1}\\\\) are free; \\\\(b_n\\\\) is forced to be 1 at the end.)  \\n\\nWe keep track of\\n- the _last two bits_ \\\\((b_{i-2},b_{i-1})\\\\), which can be \\\\(00,01,10,11\\\\) (4 states),\\n- how many 1’s have occurred so far in positions \\\\(1\\\\le j\\\\le i-1\\\\) (we only need to remember “is it \\\\(\\\\ge k-1\\\\) or not?” because \\\\(k\\\\le10\\\\)).\\n\\nWhenever we are at step \\\\(i\\\\in\\\\{3,\\\\dots,n-1\\\\}\\\\), we must \\\\emph{forbid} the transition that would produce the triple \\\\(1,0,1\\\\) at \\\\((b_{i-2},b_{i-1},b_i)\\\\).  (At \\\\(i=1,2\\\\) or at \\\\(i=n\\\\), that pattern is allowed, because a run of length 2 at the very start or very end is an end‐group of size 2, which does not cause duplication in the \\\\(b\\\\)-array.)\\n\\nDenote by \\\\(\\\\text{dp}[s][c]\\\\) the number of ways to have built up to position \\\\(i\\\\!-\\\\!1\\\\) with last‐two‐bits state \\\\(s\\\\in\\\\{0,1,2,3\\\\}\\\\) (encoding \\\\(00,01,10,11\\\\)) and “ones‐count” \\\\(c\\\\in\\\\{0,1,\\\\dots,k-2,\\\\ge k-1\\\\}\\\\).  We do the usual rolling‐array over \\\\(i\\\\).  In the end, we require that \\\\(b_n=1\\\\) but that does not change the count of ones, nor do we forbid the pattern at \\\\(i=n\\\\).  Hence the final answer is simply\\n\\\\[\\n   \\\\sum_{s=0}^3 \\\\text{dp}_\\\\text{final}[\\\\,s\\\\,][\\\\,\\\\ge k-1\\\\;]\\n   \\\\;\\\\bmod\\\\;998244353.\\n\\\\]\\n\\nComplexity is \\\\(O(n\\\\cdot 4\\\\cdot k\\\\cdot 2)=O(nk)\\\\) which for \\\\(n\\\\le2\\\\cdot10^5\\\\), \\\\(k\\\\le10\\\\) easily runs under 2 s in Java.\\n\\n---\\n\\n```java\\nimport java.io.*;\\nimport java.util.*;\\n\\npublic class Main {\\n    static final int MOD = 998244353;\\n\\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\\n        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));\\n        StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\\n        int n = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\\n        int k = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\\n        // dp[state][c] where state = last two bits in {00,01,10,11} = 0..3,\\n        // and c = how many ones so far in b[1..i-1], clipped at (k-1).\\n        int maxC = k - 1;\\n        int[][] dp = new int[4][k];\\n        int[][] nxt = new int[4][k];\\n\\n        // initial condition: we imagine b[0] = 1, and no bits yet from 1..0\\n        // so last-two bits = (b[-1],b[0]) = (0,1) => state = 0*2+1 = 1\\n        dp[1][0] = 1;\\n\\n        // build b[i] for i = 1..n-1 (free bits)\\n        for (int i = 1; i <= n - 1; i++) {\\n            for (int s = 0; s < 4; s++) {\\n                Arrays.fill(nxt[s], 0);\\n            }\\n            for (int state = 0; state < 4; state++) {\\n                int b2 = (state >> 1) & 1; // b[i-2]\\n                int b1 = state & 1;        // b[i-1]\\n                for (int c = 0; c < k; c++) {\\n                    int ways = dp[state][c];\\n                    if (ways == 0) continue;\\n                    // try bit = 0 or 1\\n                    for (int bit = 0; bit < 2; bit++) {\\n                        // forbid pattern 1,0,1 at interior i=3..n-1\\n                        if (i >= 3 && i <= n - 1) {\\n                            if (b2 == 1 && b1 == 0 && bit == 1) {\\n                                // would make \\\"101\\\" in the middle => forbid\\n                                continue;\\n                            }\\n                        }\\n                        int nc = c + bit; \\n                        if (nc > maxC) nc = maxC;\\n                        int nstate = ((b1 << 1) | bit);\\n                        nxt[nstate][nc] = (nxt[nstate][nc] + ways) % MOD;\\n                    }\\n                }\\n            }\\n            // swap dp & nxt\\n            for (int s = 0; s < 4; s++) {\\n                System.arraycopy(nxt[s], 0, dp[s], 0, k);\\n            }\\n        }\\n\\n        // finally we must set b[n] = 1, but it does not change c (we do NOT count that one),\\n        // nor do we forbid \\\"101\\\" at i=n.\\n        // Thus the final count is just sum of dp over c >= k-1\\n        long ans = 0;\\n        for (int s = 0; s < 4; s++) {\\n            ans = (ans + dp[s][maxC]) % MOD;\\n        }\\n\\n        System.out.println(ans);\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Explanation of key points**\\n\\n1.  **Break‐string**.

Needing all \\\\(k\\\\) colors forces at least \\\\(k\\\\) runs, so at least \\\\(k-1\\\\) breaks.\\n\\n2.  **Avoiding double‐count**.  \\n    Without restriction, interior groups of size 2 and two consecutive groups of size 1 produce the \\\\emph{same} little segment \\\\([1,1]\\\\) in the final distance‐array \\\\(b\\\\).  One checks that \\\\emph{no other} juggling occurs.  Concretely, requiring that \\\\emph{no interior group has length 2} is equivalent to forbidding the pattern “101” in the break‐string \\\\emph{at interior positions} (since “101” in the break‐string marks precisely a single zero flanked by ones, i.e.\\\\ an interior run of zeros of length 1 ⇒ a group of length 2 there).\\n\\n3.  **Boundary exceptions**.  \\n    A first or last group may well have size 2 without confusion in the final array \\\\(b\\\\).  Hence we only forbid “101” when it occurs in the middle of the break‐string (i.e.\\\\ indexed by \\\\(i=2,\\\\dots,n-2\\\\)), and permit it at the very ends.\\n\\n4.  **DP**.  \\n    We keep a small constant‐size state (last two bits out of \\\\(\\\\{00,01,10,11\\\\}\\\\)) plus a counter of how many 1’s have appeared so far (we only need to know “is it at least \\\\(k-1\\\\)?” since \\\\(k\\\\le10\\\\)).  We march from left to right, forbidding the short substring “101” exactly in the interior, and in the end summing all ways whose break‐count \\\\(\\\\ge k-1\\\\).  \\n\\nThis runs in \\\\(O(n\\\\cdot 4\\\\cdot k\\\\cdot 2)=O(nk)\\\\), perfectly safe for \\\\(n\\\\le2\\\\cdot10^5\\\\), \\\\(k\\\\le10\\\\) under 2 s in Java.\",\n        \"refusal\": null,\n        \"role\": \"assistant\",\n        \"annotations\": [],\n        \"audio\": null,\n        \"function_call\": null,\n        \"tool_calls\": null\n      },\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"protected_material_code\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": true,\n          \"citation\": {\n            \"URL\": \"https://github.com/ChangWoo95/ProblemSolving/tree/b8c79ab02f4158680be355a49a93eaaabe90ee1e/src%2Fmst%2FBoj_1197_%EC%B5%9C%EC%86%8C%EC%8A%A4%ED%8C%A8%EB%8B%9D%ED%8A%B8%EB%A6%AC.java\",\n            \"license\": \"NOASSERTION\"\n          }\n        },\n        \"protected_material_text\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"created\": 1753315795,\n  \"model\": \"o4-mini-2025-04-16\",\n  \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n  \"service_tier\": null,\n  \"system_fingerprint\": null,\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"completion_tokens\": 23447,\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 336,\n    \"total_tokens\": 23783,\n    \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n      \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"reasoning_tokens\": 20416,\n      \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n    },\n    \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"cached_tokens\": 0\n    }\n  },\n  \"prompt_filter_results\": [\n    {\n      \"prompt_index\": 0,\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"jailbreak\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
