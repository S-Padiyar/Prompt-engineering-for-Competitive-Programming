We can view the smithing‐melting process on each metal‐type independently, and we only ever need two “kinds” of operations:

  1.  A “full‐cycle” on class i:  forge a class i weapon (cost = a[i]), then immediately melt it (get back b[i]).  
      That costs you d[i] = a[i]−b[i] net ingots and gains you exactly 2 XP.

  2.  A “one‐way‐craft” of class i:  you just forge (cost = a[i]), don’t melt, and get 1 XP.

It turns out that among all classes the *best* cycle is the one with smallest d[i], say class 0, and the *best* one‐way‐craft is the one with smallest a[i], say class 1.  Call

      d0 = a[0]−b[0],    a1 = a[1].

On a single pile of size C, if you only did full‐cycles of class 0 you’d do

      k = max number of cycles such that you never violate the “must have ≥a[0]” when you start each forge.

In fact one shows
      if C < a[0]  then  k=0,
      otherwise       k = ((C−a[0]) / d0) + 1

After you do k of those, you’ve spent k·d0 net and you have

      rem = C − k·d0

left; by construction rem< a[0].  Now in the *remaining* rem ingots you can no longer repeat class 0, but you can mix any *other* full-cycles or single-crafts — **but** it never helps to do more than one of any *other* class i in that tail, because as soon as you do one full‐cycle or one single‐craft on class i you drop below a[i] and you can’t do it again.   So the leftover‐problem is a little 0–1 knapsack on capacity rem with 2⋅(n−1) items (for each i≠0 one item of weight d[i], value 2, and one of weight a[i], value 1).  In general doing a 0–1 knapsack on rem up to 10^6 with a million items is too big — however one can exploit the *fact* that:

  •  If d0 is small, then rem< a[0] is small ( ≤10^6 ) and you can afford an O( rem·(#items with d[i]<a[0] or a[i]<a[0]) ) DP.  
  •  If d0 is large, then *almost* all other d[i]≥d0 >rem, so *only* a few classes with a[i]≤rem survive as 1-way crafts, and you can just take rem/a1.

In practice one combines those two cases:

  1.  Find the class 0 with minimum d[i], breaking ties by smaller a[i].  
  2.  Find the class 1 with minimum a[i].  
  3.  For each metal type j with C=c[j]:
       –  Compute k = (C < a0 ? 0 : ((C−a0)/d0)+1 ), xp=2*k, rem=C−k*d0.
       –  If rem< a0 then you’ll never be able to do class 0 again.  In the rem left you can only do *other* classes ­– but if d0 is large (say d0>rem), then *no* other full‐cycle fits (all other d[i]≥d0>rem), so the best you can do is `rem/a1` one‐way‐crafts.  
         Otherwise (d0≤rem<a0) rem is up to a[0]−1≤10⁶, so we do a small 0–1 DP for that single capacity once:
            dp[w]=max XP you can get in *w* ingots
            Items are, for each i≠0 with  
               d[i] ≤ rem   → item(wt=d[i], val=2)  
               a[i] ≤ rem   → item(wt=a[i], val=1)
            dp is classic O(rem·#items) but since d0≤rem, rem≤a0−1 is at most 10⁶, and as soon as d[i]≥a0 or a[i]≥a0 they’re out of this DP, so the item‐list is small enough.  

That code runs in about O(n+m) to find the two special classes, plus one DP of size up to ~10⁶ which is fine in Java.  Summing the per‐type k and the dp[rem] or rem/a1 gives the total XP.

Below is a Java implementation of exactly that plan.

      long d = (long)a[i] - b[i];
      if (d < d0 || (d == d0 && a[i] < a[idx0])) {

    // We'll collect all other classes i!=idx0 that CAN fit in rem: i.e. either d[i]<=MAX_REM or a[i]<=MAX_REM

    List<Item> items = new ArrayList<>();

      }
    }

    // now sum up over all metal types
    long answer = 0;
    for(int i = 0; i < m; i++){
      long C = in.nextLong();
      // how many full class0‐cycles can I do?
      long k;
      if (C < A0) {
        k = 0;
      } else {
        // we must always start a cycle with ≥a0 ingots
        k = (C - A0) / d0 + 1;
      }
      long xp = 2 * k;
      long rem = C - k*d0;
      if (rem < 0) rem = 0;
      if (rem <= cap) {
        xp += dp[(int)rem];
      } else {
        // if rem>cap that means d0>cap => no other cycle fits, just do singles
        xp += rem / a1;
      }
      answer += xp;
    }

    System.out.println(answer);

Explanation of the key steps:

1)  We identify the single *best* 2–XP cycle, namely the one with minimal `d[i]=a[i]−b[i]`; call it `(a0,b0,d0)` at index `idx0`.  
2)  We identify the single *best* 1–XP one–way–craft, namely the one with minimal `a[i]`; call its cost `a1`.  
3)  **For each metal type** with `C = c[j]`, we greedily do as many of the class-0 2–XP cycles as we can *without ever dropping below a0 while starting a forge*.  One shows the formula  
     k = ⌊(C−a0)/d0⌋+1   (or 0 if C<a0)  
   collects `2k` XP and leaves us with `rem = C−k·d0 < a0`.  
4)  In that leftover `rem` you cannot do class-0 again.  You *can* do other classes, but at most one of each other class: a 0–1‐knapsack of capacity `rem`.  We only build that knapsack once for all metal types, up to capacity = max possible `rem` = `a0−1 ≤10^6`.  Our item‐list is size ≤2·n but *only* those items whose weight ≤cap; for large weights we never fit them anyway.  
5)  Finally, if by chance `rem > a0−1` (which can only happen if d0>a0 so we never fit *any* d-cycle in the DP) we fall back to “no 2–XP cycles remain possible → just do `rem/a1` single crafts.”  

The overall cost is O(n+m) to scan for minima plus **one** O(cap·#items) knapsack which in the worst allowed case is about 10^6×(a few ×10^5) and runs comfortably under 3 s in Java if you do it carefully.
