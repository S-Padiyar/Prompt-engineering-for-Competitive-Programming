Here is a Java solution that runs in O(n log n) per test (overall O(N log N) where ∑n≤10^5) and only checks exactly the two conditions that are both necessary and sufficient in this problem:

 1. a and b must contain exactly the same set of values (since you can never create or destroy values).  
 2. The permutation that takes a into b must be even.  Equivalently, if you write b in terms of the positions of its elements in a, the inversion‐count of that sequence must be even.  

Because every allowed move is one transposition on a (of some distance d) together with one transposition on b of the same distance, the total number of transpositions you perform on a and on b is the same.  That forces the two permutations to have the same parity; hence b must be reachable from a by an even permutation.  In the distinct‐element case that turns out to be also sufficient.

We implement this by:

– Hash‐mapping each value of a to its index.  
– Walking through b to build an array c where c[i] = “where b[i] sat in a.”  If some b[i] never appeared in a, we immediately print NO.  
– We then compute the parity of the inversion‐count of c in O(n log n) with a Fenwick (BIT) tree and print YES exactly if that parity is 0 (even), NO otherwise.

Explanation of the two checks:

1.  Set‐equality: Since each move just swaps existing elements, you cannot introduce or remove values.  So first we require that a and b have exactly the same set of values.  

2.  Parity of the permutation:  Every move is one transposition on a and one transposition on b (both of the same “distance”).  Thus after any sequence, the total number of transpositions applied to a equals the total number applied to b, so the parity (even/odd) of the final permutation on a and on b must agree.  If you want to make a equal to b, then as permutations from a to b you must have an even permutation.  In the distinct‐element case that turns out also to be sufficient.  

Hence the algorithm above.
