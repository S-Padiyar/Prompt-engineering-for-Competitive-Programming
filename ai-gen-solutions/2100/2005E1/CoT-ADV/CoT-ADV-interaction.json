The differences between the two versions are the constraints on all the variables. You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved.\n\n\n\nTsovak and Narek are playing a game. They have an array a\n\n and a matrix b\n\n of integers with n\n\n rows and m\n\n columns, numbered from 1\n\n. The cell in the i\n\n-th row and the j\n\n-th column is (i,j)\n\n.\n\n\n\nThey are looking for the elements of a\n\n in turns; Tsovak starts first. Each time a player looks for a cell in the matrix containing the current element of a\n\n (Tsovak looks for the first, then Narek looks for the second, etc.). Let's say a player has chosen the cell (r,c)\n\n. The next player has to choose his cell in the submatrix starting at (r+1,c+1)\n\n and ending in (n,m)\n\n (the submatrix can be empty if r=n\n\n or c=m\n\n). If a player cannot find such a cell (or the remaining submatrix is empty) or the array ends (the previous player has chosen the last element), then he loses.\n\n\n\nYour task is to determine the winner if the players play optimally.\n\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains t\n\n (1≤t≤300\n\n) – the number of test cases.\n\n\n\nThe first line of each test case contains three integers l\n\n, n\n\n, and m\n\n (1≤l,n,m≤300\n\n) – the size of the array and the sizes of the matrix.\n\n\n\nThe second line contains l\n\n integers a1,a2,a3,…al\n\n (1≤ai≤min(7,n⋅m)\n\n) – the elements of the array a\n\n.\n\n\n\nThe i\n\n-th of the last n\n\n lines contains m\n\n integers bi,1,bi,2,bi,3,…bi,m\n\n (1≤bi,j≤min(7,n⋅m)\n\n) – representing the i\n\n-th row of the matrix.\n\n\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n⋅m\n\n over all test cases does not exceed 105\n\n.\n\n\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of l\n\n over all test cases does not exceed 300\n\n.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nYou should output t\n\n lines, the i\n\n-th of them containing a character representing the answer of the i\n\n-th test case: \"T\" if Tsovak wins or \"N\", otherwise (without quotes).\n\n\n\nExample\n\nInputCopy\n\n3\n\n2 2 3\n\n1 2\n\n1 3 5\n\n4 5 2\n\n2 2 4\n\n1 2\n\n1 1 3 2\n\n4 2 5 1\n\n2 4 2\n\n1 2\n\n3 4\n\n5 5\n\n5 5\n\n5 5\n\nOutputCopy\n\nN\n\nT\n\nN\n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, Tsovak starts by looking for 1\n\n. There is only one occurrence of 1\n\n at (1,1)\n\n, so he chooses it. Then Narek needs to look for 2\n\n in the submatrix of (2,2)\n\n, which consists of just the last two elements: 5\n\n and 2\n\n. He chooses 2\n\n, and then Tsovak loses since the array has ended.\n\n\n\nIn the second example, Tsovak needs to choose 1\n\n. There is a 1\n\n at the cell (n,m)\n\n, so he chooses that cell. Then, since the submatrix of (n+1,m+1)\n\n is empty, Narek cannot find 2\n\n, so he loses.\n\n---\n\nYou are a competitive programming assistant solving Codeforces problems using Java. First, carefully read and restate the problem in your own words to ensure full understanding. Identify the input and output formats, list the constraints, and consider any edge cases that might affect the logic. Next, determine which algorithmic pattern the problem fits best—such as greedy, binary search, two pointers, dynamic programming, or graph traversal—and briefly explain why that pattern applies. Then, plan your solution step by step, describing the key ideas, data structures, or mathematical insights you’ll use. Once your plan is clear, write a clean and fully working Java program. Use import java.util.*; and include a Main class with a main method, using Scanner or BufferedReader for input depending on the constraints. Add comments to explain important logic in the code. After coding, walk through a sample input manually to show how your solution works in practice. Finally, analyze the time and space complexity of your approach using Big-O notation, justifying your answer. Think step by step and only write code once the logic is sound and complete."

Two players, Tsovak (who moves first) and Narek, take turns selecting a cell of the matrix that matches the current array element. On turn i, the player must choose a cell (r,c) such that b[r][c] = a[i].  After choosing (r,c), the next player’s choice must come from the submatrix with rows > r and columns > c.  If on your turn you cannot find a matching cell in the allowed submatrix (or the submatrix is empty), you lose.  If the previous move consumed the last element of a, then the player to move next has no more elements to match and thus also loses.  We must determine, under optimal play, whether Tsovak (the first player) wins (“T”) or loses (“N”).\\n\\nInput  \\nt — number of test cases (≤ 300).  \\nFor each test case:  \\nl, n, m (each ≤ 300)  \\na[1…l] (each ≤ 7)  \\nn rows of m integers b[i][j] (each ≤ 7)  \\nSum of (n⋅m) over all test cases ≤ 10^5.  Sum of l over all test cases ≤ 300.\\n\\nOutput  \\nFor each test case, output “T” if Tsovak wins, otherwise “N”.\\n\\nKey Observations and Algorithmic Pattern  \\n- We can view the game as a directed acyclic game of states: (pos, r, c), where pos is the current array‐index to match, and the allowed submatrix is rows ≥ r and cols ≥ c.  \\n- Define a boolean DP:   \\n  dp[pos][r][c] = “true” if the player to move at state (pos, r, c) can force a win.  \\n- Recurrence:  \\n  dp[l+1][*][*] = false (no more array elements ⇒ current player loses).  \\n  For pos from l down to 1:  \\n    dp[pos][r][c] = OR over all (x,y) with x≥r, y≥c, and b[x][y] = a[pos], of (¬dp[pos+1][x+1][y+1]).  \\n  If there is no such (x,y), dp[pos][r][c] is false.  \\n- Bruteforce is too large (l*n*m * occurrences).  But note that for fixed pos, we only need the 2D‐suffix OR of a sparsely marked grid.  In fact we can compute in O(n*m):  \\n  Let val[x][y] = 1 if b[x][y] = a[pos] and dp[pos+1][x+1][y+1] = false, else 0.  \\n  Then  \\n    dp[pos][r][c] = maximum (OR) of val[x][y] over all x≥r, y≥c  \\n  and that 2D suffix‐OR can be filled by the simple double loop from bottom‐right to top‐left:  \\n    dp[pos][r][c] = val[r][c] OR dp[pos][r+1][c] OR dp[pos][r][c+1].  \\n\\nComplexity  \\nFor each of the l layers, we do an O(n*m) sweep.

We only keep two slices of DP: dpNext for `pos+1`, and dpCurr for `pos`.  \\n2. For each `pos` (from l down to 1), we compute dpCurr[r][c] by checking if picking cell `(r,c)` is a winning move (i.e. `b[r][c]==a[pos]` and the next‐player state `dpNext[r+1][c+1]` is false) or if any choice in the suffix is winning (suffix‐OR).  \\n3. After processing all positions, dpNext[1][1] tells us whether the first player (Tsovak) can win starting from the full matrix for `a[1]`.\\n\\nSample Walk‐Through (Second Example)  \\nInput:  \\n2 2 4  \\n1 2  \\n1 1 3 2  \\n4 2 5 1  \\n\\n- Initialize dpNext all false.  \\n- pos=2, want=2 → mark val[r][c] where `b[r][c]==2` and dpNext[r+1][c+1]==false, then do suffix‐OR → dpCurr ends up marking all cells from which you can force picking a “2.”  \\n- Swap dpNext=dpCurr.  \\n- pos=1, want=1 → similarly compute dpCurr; we find dpCurr[1][1]=true, so Tsovak wins → “T.”  \\n\\nComplexity  \\nTime: O(l·n·m) per test case. Over all test cases ∑(n·m)≤10^5, ∑l≤300 ⇒ ~3·10^7 primitive operations.  \\nSpace: O(n·m) for two DP layers plus O(n·m) for the matrix, which stays well under memory limits.\",\n        \"refusal\": null,\n        \"role\": \"assistant\",\n        \"annotations\": [],\n        \"audio\": null,\n        \"function_call\": null,\n        \"tool_calls\": null\n      },\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"protected_material_code\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": true,\n          \"citation\": {\n            \"URL\": \"https://github.com/cheolyeing/BaekJoon/tree/1cf20cc129098a2ac116dc4d76e8a185c5dbc661/N17472.java\",\n            \"license\": \"NOASSERTION\"\n          }\n        },\n        \"protected_material_text\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"created\": 1753326486,\n  \"model\": \"o4-mini-2025-04-16\",\n  \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n  \"service_tier\": null,\n  \"system_fingerprint\": null,\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"completion_tokens\": 5554,\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 1018,\n    \"total_tokens\": 6572,\n    \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n      \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"reasoning_tokens\": 3712,\n      \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n    },\n    \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"cached_tokens\": 0\n    }\n  },\n  \"prompt_filter_results\": [\n    {\n      \"prompt_index\": 0,\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"jailbreak\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
