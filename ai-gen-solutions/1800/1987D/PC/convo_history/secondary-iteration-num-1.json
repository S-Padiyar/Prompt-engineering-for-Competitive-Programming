Initially, there are n\n\n cakes, with the i\n\n-th cake having a tastiness value of ai\n\n.\n\n\n\nAlice and Bob take turns eating them, with Alice starting first:\n\n\n\nIn her turn, Alice chooses and eats any remaining cake whose tastiness is strictly greater than the maximum tastiness of any of the cakes she's eaten before that. Note that on the first turn, she can choose any cake.\n\nIn his turn, Bob chooses any remaining cake and eats it.\n\nThe game ends when the current player can't eat a suitable cake. Let x\n\n be the number of cakes that Alice ate. Then, Alice wants to maximize x\n\n, while Bob wants to minimize x\n\n.\n\n\n\nFind out how many cakes Alice will eat if both players play optimally.\n\n\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a single integer t\n\n (1≤t≤500\n\n) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.\n\n\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer n\n\n (1≤n≤5000\n\n) — the number of cakes.\n\n\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n\n\n integers a1,a2,…,an\n\n (1≤ai≤n\n\n) — the tastiness values of the cakes.\n\n\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n\n\n over all test cases does not exceed 5000\n\n.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single integer — the number of cakes Alice will eat if both players play optimally.\n\n\n\nExample\n\nInputCopy\n\n9\n\n4\n\n1 4 2 3\n\n3\n\n1 1 1\n\n5\n\n1 4 2 3 4\n\n4\n\n3 4 1 4\n\n1\n\n1\n\n8\n\n4 3 2 5 6 8 3 4\n\n7\n\n6 1 1 3 5 3 1\n\n11\n\n6 11 6 8 7 5 3 11 2 3 5\n\n17\n\n2 6 5 3 9 1 6 2 5 6 3 2 3 9 6 1 6\n\nOutputCopy\n\n2\n\n1\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n3\n\n2\n\n4\n\n4\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, one possible sequence of turns is:\n\n\n\nAlice eats a cake with a tastiness value of 1\n\n.

    "content": "**Analysis**\n\nAlice and Bob are playing on a multiset of cake‐tastiness values \\(a_1,a_2,\\dots,a_n\\).  Alice’s move must strictly increase her own previously eaten maximum, Bob’s move can delete (eat) any remaining cake.  Alice wants to **maximize** the number of cakes she eats; Bob wants to **minimize** that count.\n\nA well‐known optimal strategy in such a “take‐away” game is\n\n- **Alice** always takes the *smallest* cake that is strictly larger than her previous maximum (so as to “save” as many larger cakes as possible for future moves).\n- **Bob** always takes the *largest* remaining cake (so as to destroy Alice’s future high‐value opportunities).\n\nIt can be shown that, under these two greedy rules, neither player can do better by deviating (Alice picking a larger choice earlier only reduces her future options, and Bob picking anything smaller than the maximum leaves larger ones that help Alice).  \n\nHence one can simulate the two‐pointer process on the sorted array:\n\n1. Sort the cakes nondecreasing.\n2. Maintain two indices, `L` (the next candidate for Alice, starting at 0) and `R` (the next candidate for Bob, starting at n−1).\n3. Maintain `last` as the tastiness Alice last ate (initially 0, since all ai ≥ 1).\n4. Repeat:\n   - **Alice’s turn**: advance `L` until `L>R` or `a[L]>last`.  \n     - If `L>R`, Alice cannot move → end.\n     - Otherwise Alice eats `a[L]`, increment her count, set `last = a[L]`, do `L++`.\n   - **Bob’s turn** (if there are still cakes left): do `R--` (Bob eats the largest one).\n   - Repeat.\n5. The total count at the end is the optimal number of cakes Alice will eat.\n\nThe sort is \\(O(n\\log n)\\) and the two‐pointer sweep is \\(O(n)\\).  Since the sum of \\(n\\) over all testcases is up to 5000, this method runs comfortably within time limits.\n\n---\n\n```java\nimport java.io.BufferedReader;\nimport java.io.IOException;\nimport java.io.InputStreamReader;\nimport java.util.Arrays;\nimport java.util.StringTokenizer;\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\n        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));\n        int t = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine().trim());\n        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\n        while (t-- > 0) {\n            int n = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine().trim());\n            int[] a = new int[n];\n            StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\n            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                a[i] = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\n            }\n            Arrays.sort(a);\n            \n            int L = 0, R = n - 1;\n            int last = 0;      // Alice's last eaten tastiness\n            int aliceCount = 0;\n            \n            while (true) {\n                // Alice's turn: pick the smallest > last\n                while (L <= R && a[L] <= last) {\n                    L++;\n                }\n                if (L > R) {\n                    // No valid move for Alice\n                    break;\n                }\n                // Alice eats a[L]\n                last = a[L];\n                aliceCount++;\n                L++;\n                \n                // Bob's turn: eat the largest remaining if any\n                if (L <= R) {\n                    R--;\n                } else {\n                    break;\n                }\n            }\n            \n            sb.append(aliceCount).append('\\n');\n        }\n        System.out.print(sb);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation of Key Steps**\n\n1. **Sorting**: We only care about the multiset of remaining cakes, not their original positions or order, so we sort the array.\n2. **Alice’s Strategy**: By always taking the *smallest* cake that is strictly above her current `last`, she preserves as large a “pool” for future moves as possible.\n3. **Bob’s Strategy**: By deleting the *largest* available cake each of his turns, he minimizes Alice’s future “strictly larger” choices.\n4. **Two‐Pointer Simulation**:\n   - `L` scans from left to right to find Alice’s next valid pick.\n   - `R` scans from right to left to remove Bob’s picks.\n   - We alternate these removals until Alice can no longer move.\n5. **Result**: The counter `aliceCount` accumulated over Alice’s successful turns is the optimal number she can secure, while Bob plays to minimize it."
