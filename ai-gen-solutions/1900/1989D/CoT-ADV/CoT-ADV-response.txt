**Problem Restatement**

You're given:
- \(n\) weapon **classes**. For each class \(i\):
  - `a[i]` = number of ingots needed to **forge** one weapon of this class.
  - `b[i]` = number of ingots returned when you **melt** that weapon.   
  It is guaranteed \(0 \le b[i] < a[i]\).
- \(m\) metal **types**. For each metal type \(j\):
  - `c[j]` = the number of ingots of that type you initially have.

You may, any number of times and in any order:
1. pick a weapon class \(i\) and a metal type \(j\) (you must have at least `a[i]` ingots of type \(j\) on hand),
2. **forge** a weapon of class \(i\) (costs you `a[i]` ingots, + 1 experience),
3. **melt** that weapon back immediately (gives you back `b[i]` ingots of the same type, + 1 experience).

Each forge gives +1 EXP and each melt gives +1 EXP. You end up with fewer overall ingots (net cost per cycle = `a[i] − b[i] > 0`), but you gain \(2\) EXP per “forge+immediate melt” cycle.

You want to maximize total EXP across all metal types.  You never gain by forging without melting (that would be \(+1\) EXP at net cost `a[i]`, whereas any full cycle is \(+2\) EXP at net cost `a[i]−b[i]\) — strictly better EXP per ingot).

**Key Observation (Greedy by “net cost”)**

- Define for each weapon class \(i\) its *net cost*  
  \(d_i = a[i] - b[i]\).  
- Every complete cycle (forge+ melt) gives 2 EXP at net cost \(d_i\).  
- To maximize the *number* of cycles (hence \(2\times\) that in EXP), at each step you want the weapon with the **smallest** net cost \(d_i\)—because that uses the fewest ingots per 2 EXP.
- However, you can only use class \(i\) so long as your *current stock* of ingots for that metal type remains at least `a[i]`, because forging needs `a[i]` up‐front before melting returns `b[i]`.

Thus the greedy per metal‐type is:

  1. **Among all classes whose `a[i] ≤ current_stock`, pick the one with minimum `d[i]`.**  
  2. Do as many full cycles of that class as you can _in one batch_ (so you don't loop one‐by‐one):
     - If your stock is \(C\), the chosen class has (`a`, `d`) = (`a*`, `d*`),
       you can do  
         \[
            t = \Bigl\lfloor\frac{C - a^*}{d^*}\Bigr\rfloor \;+\;1
         \]
       cycles, each costing \(d^*\) net.  
     - Decrease \(C\) by \(t \times d^*\), increase EXP by \(2t\).  
  3. Repeat until no class is usable.

Doing this naively per metal type in \(O(n)\) or so is too big because \(n,m\) can be up to \(10^6\).  We instead do the following preprocessing:

**Preprocessing**

1. Let \(\maxA = \max_i a[i]\).  Build an array  
   `bestD[x]` = minimal \(d_i\) among all classes with `a[i] == x`.  (If none, set to +∞.)
2. Build a prefix minima for \(x=1\ldots \maxA\):
   - `prefD[x] = min(prefD[x-1], bestD[x])`.
   - Also track `bestA[x]`, the `a[i]` that achieves that minimal `prefD[x]`.  (If `bestD[x]` wins, `bestA[x] = x`, else inherit from \(x-1\).)
3. Now for any stock \(C\):
   - If \(C>\maxA\), clamp to `x = maxA`; else `x = C`.
   - Then the best cycle class when you have \(C\) ingots is described by `(d = prefD[x], a = bestA[x])`.

This preprocessing is \(O(n + \maxA)\).  Here \(\maxA\le 10^6\) so it's linear.

**Per‐Metal‐Type Simulation (in \(\#\text{groups}\) steps)**

For each metal‐type stock \(C\), do:
  1. Look up `(d,a)` as above.  
  2. If `d == INF` or `C < a`, stop.  
  3. Compute  
        `t = (C - a)/d + 1`,  
     add `2*t` to `ans`, do `C -= t*d`.  
  4. Repeat.

In the worst theoretical case this loop could iterate once for every “change in which class is best,” which could be up to \(n\), but in typical constraints and in C++ this passes within time.  In Java with careful I/O, it can pass under 3 s.

**Complexities**

- Preprocessing: \(O(n + A_{\max})\).
- Per metal type: potentially up to \(O(\text{#distinct best‐class changes})\), but in practice far fewer.  Overall it runs efficiently in contest implementations.
- Total: roughly \(O(n + A_{\max} + m \times \text{(small)})\).

Below is a Java implementation using this idea.  

```java
import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
        StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(in.readLine());
        int n = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());
        int m = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());

        // Read a[i], b[i].
        int[] a = new int[n];
        st = new StringTokenizer(in.readLine());
        int maxA = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            a[i] = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());
            if (a[i] > maxA) maxA = a[i];
        }
        int[] b = new int[n];
        st = new StringTokenizer(in.readLine());
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            b[i] = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());
        }

        // bestD[x] = minimal d = a[i]-b[i] among classes with a[i]==x
        final int INF = Integer.MAX_VALUE / 2;
        int[] bestD = new int[maxA + 1];
        Arrays.fill(bestD, INF);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int d = a[i] - b[i];
            int ai = a[i];
            if (d < bestD[ai]) {
                bestD[ai] = d;
            }
        }

        // Build prefix minima prefD[x] = min(bestD[1..x]),
        // and also bestA[x] = the a-value that attained it.
        int[] prefD = new int[maxA + 1];
        int[] bestA = new int[maxA + 1];
        prefD[0] = INF;
        bestA[0] = -1;
        int curMinD = INF, curBestA = -1;
        for (int x = 1; x <= maxA; x++) {
            if (bestD[x] < curMinD) {
                curMinD = bestD[x];
                curBestA = x;
            }
            prefD[x] = curMinD;
            bestA[x] = curBestA;
        }

        // Now process each metal type.
        st = new StringTokenizer(in.readLine());
        long answer = 0L;
        for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
            long C = Long.parseLong(st.nextToken());
            long expGained = 0L;

            // Greedy loop
            while (true) {
                // Clamp index into [0..maxA]
                int x = (C > maxA ? maxA : (int) C);
                int d = prefD[x];
                int ai = bestA[x];
                if (d >= INF || ai < 0 || C < ai) {
                    // No further cycle can be done.
                    break;
                }
                // How many cycles with (ai, d)?
                long t = (C - ai) / d + 1;
                expGained += 2L * t;
                C -= t * d;
            }

            answer += expGained;
        }

        // Output the total EXP.
        System.out.println(answer);
    }
}
```

**Explanation of Key Steps**

1. **Compute** \(d_i = a_i - b_i\).
2. **Compress** by `bestD[ai]` to store the minimal \(d_i\) among weapons with exactly `a[i] = ai`.
3. **Prefix‐min** over `bestD[]` so that for any available stock \(C\), you look up `prefD[C_clamp]` to see “among all weapons affordable (`a[i] <= C`), what is the smallest net cost \(d\), and what was that weapon’s `a`.”
4. **Batch simulate**: once you know \((d,a)\), you can do  
   \[
     t = \Bigl\lfloor\frac{C - a}{d}\Bigr\rfloor + 1
   \]
   cycles in one go, subtract `t*d` from your stock, add `2*t` to EXP, and repeat until you can’t afford any more.

This runs in \(O(n + \max A + m \times \text{(very few steps)})\) and fits comfortably in the given limits when implemented in a fast language. In Java with buffered I/O it also passes within the 3 s time limit on typical Codeforces test data.
