First, carefully read and restate the problem in your own words to ensure full understanding. Identify the input and output formats, list the constraints, and consider any edge cases that might affect the logic. Next, determine which algorithmic pattern the problem fits best—such as greedy, binary search, two pointers, dynamic programming, or graph traversal—and briefly explain why that pattern applies. Then, plan your solution step by step, describing the key ideas, data structures, or mathematical insights you’ll use. Once your plan is clear, write a clean and fully working Java program. Use import java.util.*; and include a Main class with a main method, using Scanner or BufferedReader for input depending on the constraints. Add comments to explain important logic in the code. After coding, walk through a sample input manually to show how your solution works in practice. Finally, analyze the time and space complexity of your approach using Big-O notation, justifying your answer. Think step by step and only write code once the logic is sound and complete."

You must remove exactly one edge so as to minimize the number of ordered pairs (u,v) with 1 ≤ u < v ≤ n that remain reachable by some path in the resulting graph. In other words, you wish to break the graph (if possible) into two pieces whose sizes are as balanced as possible, since only pairs inside each connected component remain reachable. Removing a non‐bridge leaves the graph connected (no pairs are lost), removing a bridge splits it into two components of sizes a and b=n−a, losing a×b reachable pairs. We want to maximize a×b over all possible edges; then the answer is:\\n\\n   answer = total_pairs − max_{bridges}( a × (n−a) ),\\n   where total_pairs = n(n−1)/2.\\n\\nIf there are no bridges at all, you must remove some edge and the graph stays connected, so the answer is the full n(n−1)/2.\\n\\nInput Format  \\nt           — number of test cases (1≤t≤10^4).  \\nFor each test case:  \\n  n m       — number of vertices and edges (2≤n≤10^5, n−1≤m≤min(10^5, n(n−1)/2))  \\n  Then m lines, each has u v, an undirected edge (1≤u,v≤n, u≠v).  \\nSum of n and sum of m over all test cases ≤2⋅10^5.\\n\\nOutput Format  \\nFor each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of reachable pairs after removing exactly one edge.\\n\\nConstraints & Edge Cases  \\n- The initial graph is connected and simple (no multi‐edges or loops).  \\n- If m=n−1 (a tree), every edge is a bridge; you choose the bridge that most evenly splits the tree.  \\n- If the graph has no bridges (is 2‐edge‐connected), removing any edge leaves it connected, so answer = n(n−1)/2.  \\n- We must handle up to 2⋅10^5 total vertices and edges, so an O(n+m) or O((n+m) log n) per test set solution is required.  \\n\\nAlgorithmic Pattern  \\nThis is a graph‐traversal + bridge‐finding problem. We will use a single DFS (Tarjan’s algorithm) to compute discovery times (tin[u]), low‐link values (low[u]), and subtree sizes. Whenever we see that low[v]>tin[u] for an edge (u,v) in the DFS tree, that edge is a bridge, and the component that hangs off v has size subtreeSize[v], so removing that bridge splits the graph into (subtreeSize[v]) and (n−subtreeSize[v]). We compute the product and keep the maximum over all bridges.\\n\\nStep-by‐Step Solution Plan  \\n1. Read t.  \\n2. For each test case:  \\n   a. Read n, m.  \\n   b. Build an adjacency list of size n+1. Each entry holds pairs (neighbor, edgeID).  \\n   c.

Run DFS(1, parentEdgeID=−1) to fill tin/low/subtreeSize and detect bridges:  \\n      - Mark u visited, tin[u]=low[u]=timer++, subtreeSize[u]=1.  \\n      - For each (v, eid) in adj[u]:  \\n         • If eid==parentEdgeID, skip.  \\n         • If visited[v], low[u]=min(low[u], tin[v]).  \\n         • Else: DFS(v, eid);  \\n             subtreeSize[u]+=subtreeSize[v];  \\n             low[u]=min(low[u], low[v]);  \\n             if (low[v] > tin[u]) // bridge  \\n                let a = subtreeSize[v], b = n-a;  \\n                maxCut = max(maxCut, 1L*a*b).  \\n   e. After DFS, totalPairs = 1L*n*(n-1)/2;  \\n      answer = totalPairs − maxCut;  \\n   f. Print answer.  \\n\\nTime Complexity  \\nFor each test case, DFS runs in O(n + m).

Removing it splits the graph into two components: one of size `subSize[v]`, and the other of size `n−subSize[v]`.  \\n- We track `maxCut = max(a*(n−a))` over all bridges.  \\n- The final answer is `totalPairs - maxCut`, because we lose exactly `a*(n−a)` reachable pairs when splitting.  \\n\\nSample Walk‐through (Fourth Test from Statement)  \\nInput graph has n=6, m=7, edges:\\n1–2, 1–3, 2–3, 3–4, 4–5, 4–6, 5–6.  \\nThis graph is two triangles {1,2,3} and {4,5,6} joined by the bridge 3–4.  \\n- Initial totalPairs = 6·5/2 = 15.  \\n- The only bridge is 3–4; removing it splits into a=3 and b=3, so a·b=9.  \\n- Answer = 15 − 9 = 6, which matches the example.  \\n\\nComplexity  \\n- Time: O(n + m) per test → O(2⋅10^5) overall.  \\n- Space: O(n + m) for adjacency lists + O(n) for DFS arrays.\",\n        \"refusal\": null,\n        \"role\": \"assistant\",\n        \"annotations\": [],\n        \"audio\": null,\n        \"function_call\": null,\n        \"tool_calls\": null\n      },\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"protected_material_code\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": true,\n          \"citation\": {\n            \"URL\": \"https://github.com/j316chuck/Competitive-Programming/tree/eabf4d32590fcc423b5a0dab9cdc23ba85fae79f/Java_Solutions%2Fsrc%2FSolutions%2FPOJ%2Fpoj_2186.java\",\n            \"license\": \"NOASSERTION\"\n          }\n        },\n        \"protected_material_text\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"created\": 1753326312,\n  \"model\": \"o4-mini-2025-04-16\",\n  \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n  \"service_tier\": null,\n  \"system_fingerprint\": null,\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"completion_tokens\": 3514,\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 910,\n    \"total_tokens\": 4424,\n    \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n      \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"reasoning_tokens\": 1408,\n      \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n    },\n    \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"cached_tokens\": 0\n    }\n  },\n  \"prompt_filter_results\": [\n    {\n      \"prompt_index\": 0,\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"jailbreak\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
