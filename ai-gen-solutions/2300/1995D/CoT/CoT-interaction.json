You know that\n\n\n\nIts words consist only of the first c\n\n letters of the Latin alphabet.\n\nEach word has a case which can be unambiguously determined by its last letter (different letters correspond to different cases). For example, words \"ABACABA\" and \"ABA\" (if they exist) have the same case in this language because they both have the same ending 'A', whereas \"ALICE\" and \"BOB\" have different cases. If the language does not have a case corresponding to some letter, it means that the word cannot end with this letter.\n\nThe length of each word is k\n\n or less.\n\nYou have a single text written in this language. Unfortunately, as the language is really ancient, spaces between words are missing and all letters are uppercase. You wonder what is the minimum number of cases the language can have. Can you find this out?\n\n\n\nInput\n\nEach test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single integer t\n\n (1≤t≤10000\n\n) — the number of test cases. It is followed by descriptions of the test cases.\n\n\n\nThe first line of each test case contains three integers n\n\n, c\n\n, k\n\n (1≤k≤n≤218\n\n, 1≤c≤18\n\n) — the length of the text, the number of letters in the language, and the maximum length of the word.\n\n\n\nThe second line contains a string of n\n\n characters — the text itself. Each character is one of the first c\n\n uppercase letters of the Latin alphabet.\n\n\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n\n\n over all test cases does not exceed 218\n\n and the sum of 2c\n\n over all test cases does not exceed 218\n\n.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single line consisting of a single integer — the minimum number of cases in the language.\n\n\n\nExample\n\nInputCopy\n\n7\n\n5 5 1\n\nABCDE\n\n3 1 2\n\nAAA\n\n3 2 2\n\nAAB\n\n10 2 2\n\nABABABABAB\n\n4 4 4\n\nDCBA\n\n1 17 1\n\nQ\n\n9 3 2\n\nABCABCABC\n\nOutputCopy\n\n5\n\n1\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, there must be five cases in the language (for each of the letters 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', and 'E' there must be a case that has a corresponding ending).\n\n\n\nIn the fourth test case, one case with ending 'B' is sufficient.\n\n---\n\nLet's think step-by-step so we don't make mistakes.

We wish to “cut” the string into words of length at most `k` so that each word ends in one of a chosen subset of letters `E ⊆ {A,…}` (these letters are the “cases” of the language).  Any letter not in `E` may not be the last letter of any word.  We must cover the entire string, i.e. the last word must end exactly at position `n`.  We want to choose `E` of minimum size so that such a segmentation exists.\\n\\nA well–known equivalent condition is:\\n\\n  “ You can segment the string into blocks of length ≤ `k`, each block ending at a position whose letter lies in `E`, if and only if\\n\\n  1) the final letter `S[n]` is in `E`, and  \\n  2) in every length‐`k` window of the string, there is at least one position whose letter lies in `E`. ”\\n\\nIndeed, if any length‐`k` window had no allowed‐end letter, one would be forced to make a word longer than `k` to cross that window, which is illegal.  And clearly you must be able to end at `n`, so `S[n] ∈ E`.\\n\\nHence the problem reduces to a small‐universe hitting‐set problem.  There are `m = n−k+1` windows (if `n≥k`, otherwise there are zero windows).  For each window `i = 1..(n−k+1)`, let\\n\\n  Lᵢ = the set of *distinct* letters appearing in `S[i..i+k−1]`.\\n\\nWe must choose `E` (a subset of the `c` letters) so that\\n\\n  – for every window `i`, `E ∩ Lᵢ ≠ ∅`, and  \\n  – `S[n] ∈ E`.\\n\\nWe want `|E|` minimal.\\n\\nSince `c ≤ 18`, we can represent any subset of letters by a bit‐mask `0..(1<<c)-1`.  We form an array\\n\\n    have[mask] = 1  if  there exists some window `i` with exactly `mask` as its distinct‐letter mask.\\n\\n(We only need existence, so repeatedly setting `have[mask]=1` is fine.)\\n\\nThen a candidate mask `M` is **invalid** if there is at least one window whose letter‐mask `Lᵢ` has no intersection with `M`, i.e.\\n\\n    `Lᵢ & M == 0`.\\n\\nEquivalently, writing `U = (1<<c)-1`, the set of “bad” windows for `M` are those `Lᵢ ⊆ (U ^ M)`.  Hence `M` is invalid if and only if *some* mask `Lᵢ` is a submask of `(U^M)`.  \\n\\nWe precompute via a standard SOS (subset‐sum) DP an array\\n\\n```\\nG[X] = number of window‐masks Lᵢ that are submasks of X.\\n```\\n\\n(We only need to test `G[X]>0` or not.)  Then for each candidate `M` (such that `(M & (1<<a_n))!=0`, i.e. `M` contains the last letter), we check\\n\\n   if `G[ U^M ] == 0`  \\nthen `M` hits every window and contains the last letter, hence is valid.\\n\\nWe pick among those valid `M` the one of minimum popcount.  Its popcount is our answer.\\n\\nEdge cases:\\n\\n- If `n ≤ k` then *any* single‐letter ending that matches `S[n]` will do (there are no length‐`k` windows), so the answer is `1`.\\n- We must also remember to include `S[n]` in the chosen set, so we filter only those masks that have that bit set.\\n\\nThe overall time per test is\\n\\n- O(n) to build the sliding‐window masks and mark `have[mask]`.\\n- O(c·2ᶜ) for the SOS‐DP.\\n- O(2ᶜ) to scan all masks and pick the minimum popcount.\\n\\nSince ∑ n ≤ 2¹⁸ and ∑ 2ᶜ ≤ 2¹⁸ over all test cases, this easily fits under the time limit.\\n\\n---\\n\\n```java\\nimport java.io.*;\\nimport java.util.*;\\n\\npublic class Main {\\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\\n        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));\\n        PrintWriter  pw = new PrintWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(System.out));\\n\\n        int t = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine().trim());\\n        while (t-- > 0) {\\n            StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\\n            int n = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\\n            int c = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\\n            int k = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\\n            String s = br.readLine().trim();\\n\\n            // If the entire string is length <= k, we only need the last letter\\n            if (n <= k) {\\n                pw.println(1);\\n                continue;\\n            }\\n\\n            // Map letters 'A'.. to 0..c-1\\n            int[] a = new int[n];\\n            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\\n                a[i] = s.charAt(i) - 'A';\\n            }\\n            int lastLetter = a[n-1];\\n\\n            int FULL = (1 << c) - 1;\\n            int LIM  = 1 << c;\\n\\n            // have[mask] = 1 if some window has exactly this set of distinct letters\\n            int[] have = new int[LIM];\\n\\n            // Sliding window of size k, track counts + bitmask\\n            int[] cnt = new int[c];\\n            int winMask = 0;\\n\\n            // Initialize first window [0..k-1]\\n            for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {\\n                int x = a[i];\\n                if (cnt[x]++ == 0) {\\n                    winMask |= (1 << x);\\n                }\\n            }\\n            have[winMask] = 1;\\n\\n            // Slide window over positions 1..(n-k)\\n            for (int i = 1; i <= n - k; i++) {\\n                int out = a[i-1];\\n                if (--cnt[out] == 0) {\\n                    winMask ^= (1 << out);\\n                }\\n                int in = a[i + k - 1];\\n                if (cnt[in]++ == 0) {\\n                    winMask |= (1 << in);\\n                }\\n                have[winMask] = 1;\\n            }\\n\\n            // SOS DP: G[mask] = sum of have[submask] over all submasks of mask\\n            // so G[mask] > 0 means there is some window L_i with L_i ⊆ mask.\\n            int[] G = new int[LIM];\\n            System.arraycopy(have, 0, G, 0, LIM);\\n\\n            for (int bit = 0; bit < c; bit++) {\\n                for (int mask = 0; mask < LIM; mask++) {\\n                    if ((mask & (1 << bit)) != 0) {\\n                        G[mask] += G[mask ^ (1 << bit)];\\n                    }\\n                }\\n            }\\n\\n            // Among masks M that contain the last letter, we need G[FULL^M] == 0\\n            // i.e. no \\\"bad\\\" window.

To cross any stretch of `k` consecutive characters without an allowed‐end letter would force a word longer than `k`.  Thus every length‐`k` window must contain at least one letter from `E`.  Also the last character `S[n]` must be in `E` so as to end the final word exactly at `n`.\\n\\n2. **Masking the Windows**  \\n   We slide a window of length `k` over `S` in O(n) time.  We maintain a count of each letter and a bit‐mask `winMask` of which letters are present.  We mark `have[winMask] = 1` for each window.  This records *which* subsets of letters appear in *some* window.\\n\\n3. **SOS‐DP for Fast Validation**  \\n   We build an array\\n     \\n     G[mask] = ∑_{sub ⊆ mask} have[sub].\\n\\n   After this “subset‐sum” (SOS) DP, `G[mask]` is simply the number of windows whose letter‐mask is a submask of `mask`.  In particular, `G[mask] > 0` means “there is at least one window `Lᵢ` with `Lᵢ ⊆ mask`.”\\n\\n4. **Checking Candidate Cases**  \\n   A candidate set of cases is a mask `M`.  It is **invalid** iff there exists a window `Lᵢ` disjoint from `M`, i.e. `Lᵢ ⊆ (U ^ M)`, where `U=(1<<c)-1` is the full bit‐mask.  That condition is exactly `G[U^M] > 0`.  \\n   Hence `M` is valid iff `(M & (1<<lastLetter))≠0` (it contains the final letter) and `G[U^M] == 0` (it intersects every window).  \\n\\n5. **Answer**  \\n   We scan all `M` in `0..(1<<c)-1`, keep those that pass the test, and take the minimum `popcount(M)`.  That is the minimum number of cases needed.\\n\\nThis runs in O(n + c·2^c) time per test, which is safe for the given constraints.\",\n        \"refusal\": null,\n        \"role\": \"assistant\",\n        \"annotations\": [],\n        \"audio\": null,\n        \"function_call\": null,\n        \"tool_calls\": null\n      },\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"protected_material_code\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": true,\n          \"citation\": {\n            \"URL\": \"https://github.com/martinhoaragao/ProgrammerProfiler/tree/464577600a53339151642adc600077dddc56b2aa/ExerciseExamples%2FTREEROOT-Medium%2F8493803%2F8493803.java\",\n            \"license\": \"GPL_3_0\"\n          }\n        },\n        \"protected_material_text\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"created\": 1753310499,\n  \"model\": \"o4-mini-2025-04-16\",\n  \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n  \"service_tier\": null,\n  \"system_fingerprint\": null,\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"completion_tokens\": 9977,\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 591,\n    \"total_tokens\": 10568,\n    \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n      \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"reasoning_tokens\": 7616,\n      \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n    },\n    \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"cached_tokens\": 0\n    }\n  },\n  \"prompt_filter_results\": [\n    {\n      \"prompt_index\": 0,\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"jailbreak\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
