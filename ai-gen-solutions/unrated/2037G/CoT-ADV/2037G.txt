G. Natlan Exploring
time limit per test4 seconds
memory limit per test256 megabytes
You are exploring the stunning region of Natlan! This region consists of n
 cities, and each city is rated with an attractiveness ai
. A directed edge exists from City i
 to City j
 if and only if i<j
 and gcd(ai,aj)≠1
, where gcd(x,y)
 denotes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of integers x
 and y
.

Starting from City 1
, your task is to determine the total number of distinct paths you can take to reach City n
, modulo 998244353
. Two paths are different if and only if the set of cities visited is different.

Input
The first line contains an integer n
 (2≤n≤2⋅105
) — the number of cities.

The second line contains n
 integers a1,a2,…,an
 (2≤ai≤106
) — the attractiveness of each city.

Output
Output the total number of distinct paths you can take to reach City n
, modulo 998244353
.
