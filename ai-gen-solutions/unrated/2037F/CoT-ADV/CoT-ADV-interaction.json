You decide to use her in combat.\n\n\n\nThere are n\n\n enemies in a line. The i\n\n'th enemy from the left has health hi\n\n and is currently at position xi\n\n. Xilonen has an attack damage of m\n\n, and you are ready to defeat the enemies with her.\n\n\n\nXilonen has a powerful \"ground stomp\" attack. Before you perform any attacks, you select an integer p\n\n and position Xilonen there (p\n\n can be any integer position, including a position with an enemy currently). Afterwards, for each attack, she deals m\n\n damage to an enemy at position p\n\n (if there are any), m−1\n\n damage to enemies at positions p−1\n\n and p+1\n\n, m−2\n\n damage to enemies at positions p−2\n\n and p+2\n\n, and so on. Enemies that are at least a distance of m\n\n away from Xilonen take no damage from attacks.\n\n\n\nFormally, if there is an enemy at position x\n\n, she will deal max(0,m−|p−x|)\n\n damage to that enemy each hit. Note that you may not choose a different p\n\n for different attacks.\n\n\n\nOver all possible p\n\n, output the minimum number of attacks Xilonen must perform to defeat at least k\n\n enemies. If it is impossible to find a p\n\n such that eventually at least k\n\n enemies will be defeated, output −1\n\n instead. Note that an enemy is considered to be defeated if its health reaches 0\n\n or below.\n\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer t\n\n (1≤t≤104\n\n) – the number of test cases.\n\n\n\nThe first line of each test case contains three integers n\n\n, m\n\n, and k\n\n (1≤k≤n≤105\n\n, 1≤m≤109\n\n).\n\n\n\nThe following line contains n\n\n integers h1,h2,...,hn\n\n (1≤hi≤109\n\n).\n\n\n\nThe last line of each testcase contains n\n\n integers x1,x2,...,xn\n\n (1≤xi≤109\n\n, xi<xi+1\n\n for all 1≤i<n\n\n)\n\n\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n\n\n over all test cases does not exceed 105\n\n.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output an integer on a new line, the minimum number of attacks that must be performed to defeat at least k\n\n enemies. If it is impossible to find a p\n\n such that eventually at least k\n\n enemies will be defeated, output −1\n\n instead.\n\n\n\nExample\n\nInputCopy\n\n6\n\n5 5 3\n\n7 7 7 7 7\n\n1 2 3 4 5\n\n9 5 9\n\n2 4 6 8 10 8 6 4 2\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\n2 10 2\n\n1 1\n\n1 20\n\n2 10 1\n\n69696969 420420420\n\n1 20\n\n2 10 2\n\n10 15\n\n1 19\n\n2 2 2\n\n1000000000 1\n\n1 3\n\nOutputCopy\n\n2\n\n2\n\n-1\n\n6969697\n\n15\n\n1000000000\n\nNote\n\nIn the first testcase, it is optimal to select p=2\n\n. Each attack, the first enemy takes 5−|2−1|=4\n\n damage, the second enemy takes 5\n\n damage, the third enemy takes 4\n\n damage, the fourth enemy takes 3\n\n damage, and the fifth enemy takes 2\n\n damage. After 2\n\n attacks, the first three enemies will be defeated. It can be shown that it is impossible to defeat 3\n\n enemies in less than 2\n\n attacks, no matter which p\n\n is selected.\n\n\n\nIn the second testcase, we must kill all 9\n\n enemies. By selecting p=5\n\n, all nine enemies will be defeated in 2\n\n attacks.\n\n\n\nIn the third testcase, we must kill both enemies. However, it can be shown that no p\n\n selected will damage both enemies at the same time, so the answer is −1\n\n.\n\n\n\nIn the fourth testcase, selecting p=1\n\n will enable us to defeat the first enemy in 6969697\n\n attacks.\n\n\n\nIn the fifth testcase, selecting p=10\n\n will make each enemy take 1\n\n damage per attack. Both enemies will be defeated in 15\n\n attacks.\n\n---\n\nYou are a competitive programming assistant solving Codeforces problems using Java. First, carefully read and restate the problem in your own words to ensure full understanding. Identify the input and output formats, list the constraints, and consider any edge cases that might affect the logic. Next, determine which algorithmic pattern the problem fits best—such as greedy, binary search, two pointers, dynamic programming, or graph traversal—and briefly explain why that pattern applies. Then, plan your solution step by step, describing the key ideas, data structures, or mathematical insights you’ll use. Once your plan is clear, write a clean and fully working Java program. Use import java.util.*; and include a Main class with a main method, using Scanner or BufferedReader for input depending on the constraints. Add comments to explain important logic in the code. After coding, walk through a sample input manually to show how your solution works in practice. Finally, analyze the time and space complexity of your approach using Big-O notation, justifying your answer. Think step by step and only write code once the logic is sound and complete."

Since the stomp does \\\\(m-|p-x_i|\\\\) damage, we get the constraint\\n   \\\\[\\n     m - |p-x_i| \\\\;\\\\ge\\\\;\\\\lceil h_i/t\\\\rceil\\n     \\\\quad\\\\Longrightarrow\\\\quad\\n     |p - x_i|\\\\;\\\\le\\\\;m - \\\\bigl\\\\lceil h_i/t\\\\bigr\\\\rceil.\\n   \\\\]\\n   Hence \\\\(p\\\\) must lie in the interval\\n   \\\\[\\n     [\\\\,x_i - (m-w),\\\\;x_i + (m-w)\\\\,],\\\\quad w=\\\\lceil h_i/t\\\\rceil.\\n   \\\\]\\n   Enemies for which \\\\(w>m\\\\) are discarded (impossible to kill).\\n\\n3. **Maximum‐Overlap Check**  \\n   We have up to \\\\(n\\\\) intervals; we want to know if any integer \\\\(p\\\\) is covered by at least \\\\(k\\\\) of them.  We create “sweep events”:\\n   - \\\\((L_i, +1)\\\\) at the start of each interval,  \\n   - \\\\((R_i+1, -1)\\\\) just after the interval ends.  \\n   Sorting all events by position and scanning, we keep a running sum of “active intervals.”  If it ever reaches \\\\(k\\\\), we have a feasible placement \\\\(p\\\\).\\n\\n4. **Complexities**  \\n   - Each feasibility check (“canKillK”) takes \\\\(O(n)\\\\) to build intervals plus \\\\(O(n\\\\log n)\\\\) to sort and sweep, i.e.\\\\ \\\\(O(n\\\\log n)\\\\).  \\n   - We binary‐search over \\\\(t\\\\) in about \\\\(\\\\log(\\\\max h_i)\\\\approx30\\\\) steps.  \\n   - Hence overall \\\\(O(n\\\\,\\\\log(\\\\max h)\\\\,\\\\log n)\\\\).  With \\\\(\\\\sum n\\\\le 10^5\\\\), this runs in time within the 4-second limit.\\n\\nBy combining binary search with an interval‐overlap sweep, we efficiently find the smallest number of attacks needed (or \\\\(-1\\\\) if it cannot be done).\",\n        \"refusal\": null,\n        \"role\": \"assistant\",\n        \"annotations\": [],\n        \"audio\": null,\n        \"function_call\": null,\n        \"tool_calls\": null\n      },\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"protected_material_code\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"protected_material_text\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"created\": 1753326502,\n  \"model\": \"o4-mini-2025-04-16\",\n  \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n  \"service_tier\": null,\n  \"system_fingerprint\": null,\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"completion_tokens\": 9625,\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 1194,\n    \"total_tokens\": 10819,\n    \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n      \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"reasoning_tokens\": 6976,\n      \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n    },\n    \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"cached_tokens\": 0\n    }\n  },\n  \"prompt_filter_results\": [\n    {\n      \"prompt_index\": 0,\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"jailbreak\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
