Maximize the Largest Component (Hard Version)\n\ntime limit per test2 seconds\n\nmemory limit per test512 megabytes\n\nEasy and hard versions are actually different problems, so read statements of both problems completely and carefully. The only difference between the two versions is the operation.\n\n\n\nAlex has a grid with n\n\n rows and m\n\n columns consisting of '.' and '#' characters. A set of '#' cells forms a connected component if from any cell in this set, it is possible to reach any other cell in this set by only moving to another cell in the set that shares a common side. The size of a connected component is the number of cells in the set.\n\n\n\nIn one operation, Alex selects any row r\n\n (1≤r≤n\n\n) and any column c\n\n (1≤c≤m\n\n), then sets every cell in row r\n\n and column c\n\n to be '#'. Help Alex find the maximum possible size of the largest connected component of '#' cells that he can achieve after performing the operation at most once.\n\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer t\n\n (1≤t≤104\n\n) — the number of test cases.\n\n\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers n\n\n and m\n\n (1≤n⋅m≤106\n\n) — the number of rows and columns of the grid.\n\n\n\nThe next n\n\n lines each contain m\n\n characters.

We want the maximum size of the largest connected component of `#`‐cells (4‐connectivity) after at most one such operation (we may also choose to do nothing).\\n\\nLet us write\\n\\n  • \\\\(\\\\mathrm{origMax}\\\\) = the size of the largest connected component in the original grid (no operation).  \\n  • \\\\(\\\\mathrm{plusSize}=\\\\,n + m - 1\\\\), the total number of cells in one full row plus one full column (the intersection \\\\((r,c)\\\\) is counted only once).  \\n\\nIf we actually perform the operation on \\\\((r,c)\\\\), then in the resulting grid:\\n\\n  1. The “plus” (row \\\\(r\\\\) and column \\\\(c\\\\)) contributes \\\\(\\\\mathrm{plusSize}\\\\) cells total.\\n  2. Any original components of `#` that touch the plus either by having a `#` in row \\\\(r\\\\) or column \\\\(c\\\\), **or** by having a `#` in one of the adjacent rows \\\\(\\\\{r-1,r+1\\\\}\\\\) next to the newly‐filled row \\\\(r\\\\), or in one of the adjacent columns \\\\(\\\\{c-1,c+1\\\\}\\\\) next to the newly‐filled column \\\\(c\\\\), all become merged into one big component.  \\n\\nHence the final merged component size is\\n\\\\[\\n  \\\\underbrace{\\\\mathrm{plusSize}}_{\\\\text{newly filled row+col}}\\n  \\\\;+\\\\;\\n  \\\\sum_{\\\\substack{\\\\text{all original components}\\\\\\\\\\n                 \\\\text{that merge with the plus}}}\\n    (\\\\text{size of that component})\\n  \\\\;-\\\\;\\n  (\\\\text{number of `#` on the plus in the original grid}),\\n\\\\]\\nbecause we must not double‐count the `#` that were already on the plus before the operation.\\n\\nDefine\\n\\n  • \\\\(\\\\mathrm{rowHash}[r]\\\\) = how many `#`’s are in row \\\\(r\\\\) initially.  \\n  • \\\\(\\\\mathrm{colHash}[c]\\\\) = how many `#`’s are in column \\\\(c\\\\) initially.  \\n  • overlap \\\\(\\\\mathrm{ov}(r,c)\\\\)= 1 if cell \\\\((r,c)\\\\) is `#` initially, else 0.  \\n\\nThen “number of `#` on the plus” = \\\\(\\\\mathrm{rowHash}[r]+\\\\mathrm{colHash}[c]-\\\\mathrm{ov}(r,c)\\\\).\\n\\nWe now need to figure out efficiently, for each \\\\(r\\\\) and \\\\(c\\\\), **which** original components merge with the plus.  Equivalently, for each connected component \\\\(k\\\\) we can precompute:\\n\\n- The set \\\\(\\\\mathrm{R}_k\\\\) of rows in which component \\\\(k\\\\) has cells (plus each of those rows \\\\(\\\\pm1\\\\), clipped to \\\\([0,n-1]\\\\)).  \\n- The set \\\\(\\\\mathrm{C}_k\\\\) of columns in which component \\\\(k\\\\) has cells (plus each of those columns \\\\(\\\\pm1\\\\), clipped to \\\\([0,m-1]\\\\)).  \\n\\nThen component \\\\(k\\\\) merges with the plus if and only if our chosen \\\\((r,c)\\\\) lies in \\\\(\\\\mathrm{R}_k\\\\times \\\\mathrm{C}_k\\\\).  If we did not have to worry about subtracting the original `#`‐overlap on the plus, the size gained from component \\\\(k\\\\) would simply be \\\\(\\\\text{size}_k\\\\).  \\n\\nPutting everything together, one finds that the contribution of component \\\\(k\\\\) is **added** once in the sum over row‐neighbors of \\\\(r\\\\), plus once in the sum over column‐neighbors of \\\\(c\\\\), and so it is counted twice if \\\\((r,c)\\\\in \\\\mathrm{R}_k\\\\times \\\\mathrm{C}_k\\\\).  Thus in a “row‐only” total plus a “column‐only” total we have overcounted the intersection once, and must subtract \\\\(\\\\text{size}_k\\\\) exactly on all \\\\((r,c)\\\\in \\\\mathrm{R}_k\\\\times \\\\mathrm{C}_k\\\\).\\n\\nConcretely:\\n\\n1. Find all connected components of the original `#`‐graph with a BFS/DFS.  Record for each cell its `compId` and for each component its size.\\n2. Build for each row \\\\(r\\\\) the list of component‐IDs that appear in rows \\\\(r-1,r,r+1\\\\).  Call that total \\\\(\\\\mathrm{rowSum}[r]\\\\).  Similarly build for each column \\\\(c\\\\) the total \\\\(\\\\mathrm{colSum}[c]\\\\) from columns \\\\(c-1,c,c+1\\\\).  In each sum we add up the sizes of distinct components that appear in those three rows (or three columns).\\n3. For each \\\\((r,c)\\\\) define a **base** value\\n   \\\\[\\n     H(r,c)\\\\;=\\\\;\\\\bigl(\\\\mathrm{rowSum}[r]-\\\\mathrm{rowHash}[r]\\\\bigr)\\\\;+\\\\;\\\\bigl(\\\\mathrm{colSum}[c]-\\\\mathrm{colHash}[c]\\\\bigr)\\\\;+\\\\;\\\\mathrm{ov}(r,c).\\n   \\\\]\\n   One checks that\\n   \\\\[\\n     H(r,c)\\n     \\\\;=\\\\;\\n     \\\\bigl[\\\\sum_{\\\\substack{k: \\\\text{in row‐window}(r)}}\\\\mathrm{size}_k\\\\bigr]\\n     -\\\\mathrm{rowHash}[r]\\n     \\\\;+\\\\;\\n     \\\\bigl[\\\\sum_{\\\\substack{k: \\\\text{in col‐window}(c)}}\\\\mathrm{size}_k\\\\bigr]\\n     -\\\\mathrm{colHash}[c]\\n     \\\\;+\\\\;\\\\mathrm{ov}(r,c).\\n   \\\\]\\n4. Now we must subtract the overcount: every component \\\\(k\\\\) that lies both in the row‐window of \\\\(r\\\\) and the column‐window of \\\\(c\\\\) we have counted twice, so we subtract \\\\(\\\\mathrm{size}_k\\\\) on every \\\\((r,c)\\\\in \\\\mathrm{R}_k\\\\times \\\\mathrm{C}_k\\\\).  We perform these subtractions by iterating over each component \\\\(k\\\\), forming the (usually small) Cartesian product \\\\(\\\\mathrm{R}_k\\\\times \\\\mathrm{C}_k\\\\), and doing\\n   \\\\[\\n     F(r,c)\\\\;-\\\\!=\\\\;\\\\mathrm{size}_k\\n     \\\\quad\\\\text{for each }(r,c)\\\\in \\\\mathrm{R}_k\\\\times \\\\mathrm{C}_k.\\n   \\\\]\\n5. After all that, the value\\n   \\\\[\\n     F(r,c)\\\\;=\\\\;H(r,c)\\\\;-\\\\;\\\\sum_{k: (r,c)\\\\in \\\\mathrm{R}_k\\\\times \\\\mathrm{C}_k}\\\\!\\\\mathrm{size}_k\\n   \\\\]\\n   satisfies\\n   \\\\[\\n     F(r,c)\\\\;=\\\\;\\\\Bigl[\\\\text{sum of all merged component‐sizes}\\\\Bigr]\\n        \\\\;-\\\\;\\\\bigl(\\\\mathrm{rowHash}[r]+\\\\mathrm{colHash}[c]-\\\\mathrm{ov}(r,c)\\\\bigr).\\n   \\\\]\\n   Hence the final component size upon choosing \\\\((r,c)\\\\) is\\n   \\\\[\\n     \\\\mathrm{plusSize}\\\\;+\\\\;F(r,c).\\n   \\\\]\\n6. We take the maximum of \\\\(\\\\mathrm{plusSize}+F(r,c)\\\\) over all \\\\((r,c)\\\\), and also compare with \\\\(\\\\mathrm{origMax}\\\\) (the size from doing no operation).  That is our answer.\\n\\nBecause each component \\\\(k\\\\) contributes a small number of rows \\\\(\\\\mathrm{R}_k\\\\) and columns \\\\(\\\\mathrm{C}_k\\\\), and the sum of all component‐sizes is at most the total number of `#`’s \\\\(\\\\le n\\\\,m\\\\), the total work making those subtractions is \\\\(\\\\sum_k|\\\\mathrm{R}_k|\\\\cdot|\\\\mathrm{C}_k|\\\\), which is provably \\\\(O(nm)\\\\) in the worst case.  All other steps—BFS/DFS, building sums, one final scan—are also \\\\(O(nm)\\\\).  Thus the overall solution runs in \\\\(O(nm)\\\\) per test, and the sum of \\\\(nm\\\\) over all tests is \\\\(\\\\le10^6\\\\), which fits easily in time.\\n\\nBelow is a complete Java implementation.\\n\\n```java\\nimport java.io.*;\\nimport java.util.*;\\n\\npublic class Main {\\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\\n        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));\\n        PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(System.out);\\n\\n        int t = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine().trim());\\n        while (t-- > 0) {\\n            String[] nm = br.readLine().split(\\\" \\\");\\n            int n = Integer.parseInt(nm[0]);\\n            int m = Integer.parseInt(nm[1]);\\n\\n            char[][] grid = new char[n][];\\n            for (int i = 0;

We also record the size of each component (the number of cells in it).  This gives us `compId[cell]` and `compSize[id]`.\\n\\n2. **Row/Column Hash Counts**  \\n   We count, for each row \\\\(r\\\\), how many `#`’s originally lie in that row: `rowHash[r]`.  Similarly for each column \\\\(c\\\\): `colHash[c]`.  We also record when \\\\((r,c)\\\\) itself is `#`, which we call `overlap`.\\n\\n3. **Row‐Window Sums**  \\n   When we fill row \\\\(r\\\\), we join all components that appear in rows \\\\(\\\\{r-1,r,r+1\\\\}\\\\).  We form `rowSum[r] =` the sum of **distinct** component‐sizes that occur in those three rows.  We do that by collecting the component‐IDs in each of the three rows into one set, then summing their sizes.\\n\\n4. **Column‐Window Sums**  \\n   Similarly `colSum[c]` = sum of **distinct** component‐sizes in columns \\\\(\\\\{c-1,c,c+1\\\\}\\\\).\\n\\n5. **Partial Total \\\\(H(r,c)\\\\)**  \\n   If we choose \\\\((r,c)\\\\), then from the row‐side we add `rowSum[r]`, but we must not double‐count the cells in row \\\\(r\\\\) already `#`, so we subtract `rowHash[r]`.  Likewise from the column side we add `colSum[c] - colHash[c]`.  Finally we add 1 if \\\\((r,c)\\\\) itself was a `#` (because it got subtracted twice).  Altogether\\n   \\\\[\\n     H(r,c)\\\\;=\\\\;\\\\bigl[\\\\mathrm{rowSum}[r]-\\\\mathrm{rowHash}[r]\\\\bigr]\\n           +\\\\bigl[\\\\mathrm{colSum}[c]-\\\\mathrm{colHash}[c]\\\\bigr]\\n           +\\\\mathrm{ov}(r,c).\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n6. **Subtracting the Overcount**  \\n   Any component \\\\(k\\\\) that is counted in both the row‐window of \\\\(r\\\\) and the column‐window of \\\\(c\\\\) has been added *twice* in \\\\(H(r,c)\\\\).  We must subtract its full size once more to count it only once.  \\n   - We precompute for each component \\\\(k\\\\) the list of rows it occupies (call it `compRows[k]`) and the list of columns it occupies (`compCols[k]`).  \\n   - Then the “row‐window” indices \\\\(\\\\mathrm{R}_k\\\\) are each row in `compRows[k]` plus \\\\(\\\\pm1\\\\) (clipped).  The “column‐window” \\\\(\\\\mathrm{C}_k\\\\) is each column in `compCols[k]` plus \\\\(\\\\pm1\\\\).  \\n   - For every \\\\((r,c)\\\\in \\\\mathrm{R}_k\\\\times \\\\mathrm{C}_k\\\\) we subtract `compSize[k]` from `F[r*m+c]`.  \\n\\n7. **Final Answer**  \\n   After step 6 we have\\n   \\\\[\\n     F(r,c)\\\\;=\\\\;H(r,c)\\\\;-\\\\;\\\\sum_{k : (r,c)\\\\in \\\\mathrm{R}_k\\\\times \\\\mathrm{C}_k}\\\\!\\\\mathrm{size}_k\\n            \\\\;=\\\\;\\\\Bigl[\\\\text{total size of merged components}\\\\Bigr]\\n             -\\\\bigl(\\\\mathrm{rowHash}[r]+\\\\mathrm{colHash}[c]-\\\\mathrm{ov}(r,c)\\\\bigr).\\n   \\\\]\\n   Therefore the new component size is \\n   \\\\(\\\\mathrm{plusSize}+F(r,c)\\\\).\\n   We scan all \\\\((r,c)\\\\), take the maximum of \\\\(\\\\mathrm{plusSize}+F(r,c)\\\\), and also compare with the original largest component (`origMax`), because we are allowed *not* to perform the operation at all.\\n\\nThis algorithm runs in \\\\(O(nm)\\\\) per test, and since the sum of \\\\(nm\\\\) over all tests is at most \\\\(10^6\\\\), it is easily fast enough under the given constraints.\",\n        \"refusal\": null,\n        \"role\": \"assistant\",\n        \"annotations\": [],\n        \"audio\": null,\n        \"function_call\": null,\n        \"tool_calls\": null\n      },\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"protected_material_code\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": true,\n          \"citation\": {\n            \"URL\": \"https://github.com/Ahmed-ShawkyEgy/UVA/tree/af254ea6974e5f8d13e805721895f4b5d77df564/591%20-%20Box%20of%20Bricks.java\",\n            \"license\": \"NOASSERTION\"\n          }\n        },\n        \"protected_material_text\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"created\": 1753310263,\n  \"model\": \"o4-mini-2025-04-16\",\n  \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n  \"service_tier\": null,\n  \"system_fingerprint\": null,\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"completion_tokens\": 18629,\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 597,\n    \"total_tokens\": 19226,\n    \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n      \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"reasoning_tokens\": 13568,\n      \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n    },\n    \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"cached_tokens\": 0\n    }\n  },\n  \"prompt_filter_results\": [\n    {\n      \"prompt_index\": 0,\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"jailbreak\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
