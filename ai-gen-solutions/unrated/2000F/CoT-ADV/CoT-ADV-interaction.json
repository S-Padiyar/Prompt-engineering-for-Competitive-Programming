First, carefully read and restate the problem in your own words to ensure full understanding. Identify the input and output formats, list the constraints, and consider any edge cases that might affect the logic. Next, determine which algorithmic pattern the problem fits best—such as greedy, binary search, two pointers, dynamic programming, or graph traversal—and briefly explain why that pattern applies. Then, plan your solution step by step, describing the key ideas, data structures, or mathematical insights you’ll use. Once your plan is clear, write a clean and fully working Java program. Use import java.util.*; and include a Main class with a main method, using Scanner or BufferedReader for input depending on the constraints. Add comments to explain important logic in the code. After coding, walk through a sample input manually to show how your solution works in practice. Finally, analyze the time and space complexity of your approach using Big-O notation, justifying your answer. Think step by step and only write code once the logic is sound and complete."

Rectangle \\\\(i\\\\) has width \\\\(a_i\\\\) and height \\\\(b_i\\\\).  We can color individual cells one at a time.  Whenever we manage to fully color an entire row of a rectangle (all its \\\\(a_i\\\\) cells) or an entire column (all its \\\\(b_i\\\\) cells), we earn one point per completed row or column.  Coloring the same cell twice does nothing extra.\\n\\nWe need to collect at least \\\\(k\\\\) points total (summing over all rectangles).  Our task is to minimize the total number of single–cell coloring operations used.  If it is impossible to reach \\\\(k\\\\) points, we output \\\\(-1\\\\).\\n\\nKey insights\\n\\n1.  **Within one rectangle** of dimensions \\\\(a \\\\times b\\\\), if we choose to fully color \\\\(r\\\\) rows and \\\\(c\\\\) columns,\\n    - we earn \\\\(r + c\\\\) points,\\n    - we must color all cells in those rows and columns.  Naïvely that seems to cost \\\\(r\\\\cdot a + c\\\\cdot b\\\\) operations, but those \\\\(r \\\\times c\\\\) intersections are double–counted.  So the true cost is\\n      \\\\[\\n        \\\\text{cost}(r,c) \\\\;=\\\\;\\n        r\\\\,a \\\\;+\\\\; c\\\\,b \\\\;-\\\\; r\\\\,c.\\n      \\\\]\\n2.  For a single rectangle \\\\(i\\\\), define\\n    \\\\[\\n       g_i(t) \\\\;=\\\\;\\n       \\\\min_{\\\\substack{0 \\\\le r \\\\le b_i,\\\\,0 \\\\le c \\\\le a_i\\\\\\\\r+c = t}}\\n       \\\\bigl[r\\\\,a_i \\\\;+\\\\; c\\\\,b_i - r\\\\,c\\\\bigr],\\n       \\\\quad\\n       t=0,1,\\\\dots,a_i+b_i.\\n    \\\\]\\n    That is the minimum cost to earn exactly \\\\(t\\\\) points from that rectangle.\\n3.  We now have a classic “group knapsack” over the rectangles.  We maintain a global DP array\\n   \\\\[\\n      \\\\mathrm{dp}[j]\\n      =\\n      \\\\text{minimum cost to earn exactly } j \\\\text{ points so far},\\n      \\\\quad j=0,1,\\\\dots,k.\\n   \\\\]\\n   Initially \\\\(\\\\mathrm{dp}[0]=0\\\\), and \\\\(\\\\mathrm{dp}[1\\\\ldots k]=\\\\infty\\\\).  \\n4.  For each rectangle \\\\(i\\\\), we merge it into the global DP by trying all ways \\\\(t\\\\) of taking points from that rectangle (from \\\\(1\\\\) up to \\\\(\\\\min(k,a_i+b_i)\\\\)), and doing\\n   \\\\[\\n     \\\\mathrm{dp\\\\_new}[j+t]\\n     \\\\;=\\\\;\\n     \\\\min\\\\bigl(\\\\mathrm{dp\\\\_new}[j+t],\\\\;\\\\mathrm{dp}[j] + g_i(t)\\\\bigr),\\n   \\\\]\\n   iterating \\\\(j\\\\) from \\\\(k\\\\) down to \\\\(0\\\\) to avoid double–counting in one rectangle.\\n5.  At the end, if \\\\(\\\\mathrm{dp}[k]\\\\) is still \\\\(\\\\infty\\\\), answer \\\\(-1\\\\); otherwise output \\\\(\\\\mathrm{dp}[k]\\\\).\\n\\nComplexities\\n\\n- We only ever need points up to \\\\(k\\\\le100\\\\).\\n- For each rectangle \\\\(i\\\\):\\n  - We compute \\\\(g_i(t)\\\\) for \\\\(t=0\\\\ldots U\\\\), where \\\\(U=\\\\min(k,\\\\,a_i+b_i)\\\\).  Computing each \\\\(g_i(t)\\\\) takes up to \\\\(O(a_i+b_i)\\\\) tries of splitting into \\\\((r,c)\\\\).  Since \\\\(a_i,b_i\\\\le100\\\\), that is \\\\(O(200)\\\\) work per rectangle.\\n  - We then merge into the global DP in \\\\(O(k\\\\cdot U)\\\\), again up to \\\\(100\\\\cdot200=2\\\\!000\\\\) steps.\\n- With \\\\(n\\\\le1000\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\sum n\\\\le1000\\\\) over all test cases, the total work is roughly \\n  \\\\[\\n    O\\\\bigl(\\\\sum_i (200 + 20000)\\\\bigr)\\\\;\\\\approx\\\\; O(20\\\\,\\\\mathrm{million}),\\n  \\\\]\\n  which runs comfortably within the 3-second limit in Java.\\n\\nJava Implementation\\n\\n```java\\nimport java.io.*;\\nimport java.util.*;\\n\\npublic class Main {\\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\\n        BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));\\n        StringTokenizer st;\\n\\n        int t = Integer.parseInt(in.readLine().trim());\\n        final int INF = 1_000_000_000;\\n\\n        while (t-- > 0) {\\n            st = new StringTokenizer(in.readLine());\\n            int n = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\\n            int k = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\\n\\n            // dp[j] = min cost to earn exactly j points so far\\n            int[] dp = new int[k + 1];\\n            Arrays.fill(dp, INF);\\n            dp[0] = 0;\\n\\n            // Keep track of maximum possible total points\\n            int sumPoints = 0;\\n\\n            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\\n                st = new StringTokenizer(in.readLine());\\n                int a = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\\n                int b = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\\n                sumPoints += a + b;\\n\\n                // We only need g[t] up to t = min(k, a+b)\\n                int U = Math.min(k, a + b);\\n                int[] g = new int[U + 1];\\n                Arrays.fill(g, INF);\\n                g[0] = 0;\\n\\n                // Precompute the best cost g[t] for exactly t points from this rectangle\\n                for (int tPts = 1; tPts <= U; tPts++) {\\n                    // We choose r rows and c cols with r + c = tPts\\n                    // 0 <= r <= b, 0 <= c <= a\\n                    int best = INF;\\n                    // r = number of rows\\n                    int rMin = Math.max(0, tPts - a);\\n                    int rMax = Math.min(tPts, b);\\n                    for (int r = rMin; r <= rMax; r++) {\\n                        int c = tPts - r;\\n                        int cost = r * a + c * b - r * c; \\n                        if (cost < best) best = cost;\\n                    }\\n                    g[tPts] = best;\\n                }\\n\\n                // Merge g[] into the global dp[] with a group-knapsack step\\n                for (int j = k; j >= 0; j--) {\\n                    if (dp[j] == INF) continue;\\n                    for (int tPts = 1; tPts <= U && j + tPts <= k; tPts++) {\\n                        int cst = g[tPts];\\n                        if (cst == INF) continue;\\n                        dp[j + tPts] = Math.min(dp[j + tPts], dp[j] + cst);\\n                    }\\n                }\\n            }\\n\\n            // If total possible points < k, impossible\\n            if (sumPoints < k || dp[k] >= INF) {\\n                System.out.println(-1);\\n            } else {\\n                System.out.println(dp[k]);\\n            }\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nExplanation of Key Steps\\n\\n1. **Reading Input**  \\n   We read \\\\(t\\\\) test cases.

If the overall sum of possible points (`sumPoints = ∑(a_i+b_i)`) is less than \\\\(k\\\\) or `dp[k]` is still infinite, we print \\\\(-1\\\\); otherwise we print `dp[k]`.\\n\\nTime and Space Complexity\\n\\n- Time: \\n  - For each rectangle, computing `g[t]` for \\\\(t\\\\le200\\\\) takes \\\\(O(200)\\\\) by iterating possible row–column splits.\\n  - Merging into the global DP takes \\\\(O(k\\\\cdot U)\\\\le O(100\\\\cdot200)=20{,}000\\\\).\\n  - With up to \\\\(n=1000\\\\) rectangles, that's on the order of \\\\(O(20\\\\times10^6)\\\\), which fits in the 3-second limit in Java.\\n- Space:\\n  - We use \\\\(O(k)\\\\approx O(100)\\\\) memory for `dp[]` and up to \\\\(O(200)\\\\) for each `g[]`.\\n  \\nThus the solution is efficient and correct under the given constraints.\",\n        \"refusal\": null,\n        \"role\": \"assistant\",\n        \"annotations\": [],\n        \"audio\": null,\n        \"function_call\": null,\n        \"tool_calls\": null\n      },\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"protected_material_code\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": true,\n          \"citation\": {\n            \"URL\": \"https://github.com/GDAndres98/maratones/tree/9bfbbd85d5fc90809804c3bec50d25dfa666d48c/UVa%2Fsrc%2FUVa10959_ThePartyPartI.java\",\n            \"license\": \"NOASSERTION\"\n          }\n        },\n        \"protected_material_text\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"created\": 1753326427,\n  \"model\": \"o4-mini-2025-04-16\",\n  \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n  \"service_tier\": null,\n  \"system_fingerprint\": null,\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"completion_tokens\": 6507,\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 709,\n    \"total_tokens\": 7216,\n    \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n      \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"reasoning_tokens\": 4352,\n      \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n    },\n    \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n      \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n      \"cached_tokens\": 0\n    }\n  },\n  \"prompt_filter_results\": [\n    {\n      \"prompt_index\": 0,\n      \"content_filter_results\": {\n        \"hate\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"jailbreak\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"detected\": false\n        },\n        \"self_harm\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"sexual\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        },\n        \"violence\": {\n          \"filtered\": false,\n          \"severity\": \"safe\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
