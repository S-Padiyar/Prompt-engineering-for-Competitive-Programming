B. Make It Equal
time limit per test2 seconds
memory limit per test512 megabytes
You are given an integer array a
 of size n
. The elements of the array are numbered from 1
 to n
.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly, zero): choose an index i
 from 1
 to n
; decrease ai
 by 2
 and increase a(imodn)+1
 by 1
.

After you perform the operations, all elements of the array should be non-negative equal integers.

Your task is to calculate the minimum number of operations you have to perform.

Input
The first line contains a single integer t
 (1≤t≤104
) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n
 (2≤n≤2⋅105
).

The second line of each test case contains n
 integers a1,a2,…,an
 (1≤ai≤109
).

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n
 over all test cases doesn't exceed 2⋅105
.

Output
For each test case, print a single integer — the minimum number of operations you have to perform. If it is impossible to make all elements of the array equal, print -1.
