Deterministic Heap (Easy Version)\n\ntime limit per test3 seconds\n\nmemory limit per test512 megabytes\n\nThis is the easy version of the problem. The difference between the two versions is the definition of deterministic max-heap, time limit, and constraints on n\n\n and t\n\n. You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved.\n\n\n\nConsider a perfect binary tree with size 2n−1\n\n, with nodes numbered from 1\n\n to 2n−1\n\n and rooted at 1\n\n. For each vertex v\n\n (1≤v≤2n−1−1\n\n), vertex 2v\n\n is its left child and vertex 2v+1\n\n is its right child. Each node v\n\n also has a value av\n\n assigned to it.\n\n\n\nDefine the operation pop\n\n as follows:\n\n\n\ninitialize variable v\n\n as 1\n\n;\n\nrepeat the following process until vertex v\n\n is a leaf (i.e. until 2n−1≤v≤2n−1\n\n);\n\namong the children of v\n\n, choose the one with the larger value on it and denote such vertex as x\n\n; if the values on them are equal (i.e. a2v=a2v+1\n\n), you can choose any of them;\n\nassign ax\n\n to av\n\n (i.e. av:=ax\n\n);\n\nassign x\n\n to v\n\n (i.e. v:=x\n\n);\n\nassign −1\n\n to av\n\n (i.e. av:=−1\n\n).\n\nThen we say the pop\n\n operation is deterministic if there is a unique way to do such operation. In other words, a2v≠a2v+1\n\n would hold whenever choosing between them.\n\n\n\nA binary tree is called a max-heap if for every vertex v\n\n (1≤v≤2n−1−1\n\n), both av≥a2v\n\n and av≥a2v+1\n\n hold.\n\n\n\nA max-heap is deterministic if the pop\n\n operation is deterministic to the heap when we do it for the first time.\n\n\n\nInitially, av:=0\n\n for every vertex v\n\n (1≤v≤2n−1\n\n), and your goal is to count the number of different deterministic max-heaps produced by applying the following operation add\n\n exactly k\n\n times:\n\n\n\nChoose an integer v\n\n (1≤v≤2n−1\n\n) and, for every vertex x\n\n on the path between 1\n\n and v\n\n, add 1\n\n to ax\n\n.\n\nTwo heaps are considered different if there is a node which has different values in the heaps.\n\n\n\nSince the answer might be large, print it modulo p\n\n.\n\n\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t\n\n (1≤t≤500\n\n). The description of the test cases follows.\n\n\n\nThe first line of each test case contains three integers n,k,p\n\n (1≤n,k≤500\n\n, 108≤p≤109\n\n, p\n\n is a prime).\n\n\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n\n\n and the sum of k\n\n over all test cases does not exceed 500\n\n.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single line containing an integer: the number of different deterministic max-heaps produced by applying the aforementioned operation add\n\n exactly k\n\n times, modulo p\n\n.\n\n\n\nExamples\n\nInputCopy\n\n7\n\n1 13 998244353\n\n2 1 998244353\n\n3 2 998244853\n\n3 3 998244353\n\n3 4 100000037\n\n4 2 100000039\n\n4 3 100000037\n\nOutputCopy\n\n1\n\n2\n\n12\n\n52\n\n124\n\n32\n\n304\n\nInputCopy\n\n1\n\n500 500 100000007\n\nOutputCopy\n\n76297230\n\nInputCopy\n\n6\n\n87 63 100000037\n\n77 77 100000039\n\n100 200 998244353\n\n200 100 998244353\n\n32 59 998244853\n\n1 1 998244353\n\nOutputCopy\n\n26831232\n\n94573603\n\n37147649\n\n847564946\n\n727060898\n\n1\n\nNote\n\nFor the first testcase, there is only one way to generate a\n\n, and such sequence is a deterministic max-heap, so the answer is 1\n\n.\n\n\n\nFor the second testcase, if we choose v=1\n\n and do the operation, we would have a=[1,0,0]\n\n, and since a2=a3\n\n, we can choose either of them when doing the first pop\n\n operation, so such heap is not a deterministic max-heap.\n\n\n\nAnd if we choose v=2\n\n, we would have a=[1,1,0]\n\n, during the first pop\n\n, the following would happen:\n\n\n\ninitialize v\n\n as 1\n\nsince a2v>a2v+1\n\n, choose 2v\n\n as x\n\n, then x=2\n\nassign ax\n\n to av\n\n, then a=[1,1,0]\n\nassign x\n\n to v\n\n, then v=2\n\nsince v\n\n is a leaf, assign −1\n\n to av\n\n, then a=[1,−1,0]\n\nSince the first pop\n\n operation is deterministic, this is a deterministic max-heap.

What can fail is *determinism* of the pop operation:  when we pop, we start at the root and always move to the *strictly* larger child; if the two children were ever *equal*, the pop would have a choice and so would *not* be deterministic.  We only care about the *first* pop, so we only require strict inequality on the unique path from the root down to whichever leaf we end at during that pop.\\n\\nBut whichever path is actually taken depends on the values, and for a heap to be deterministic there must be *some* unique path from the root to a leaf—indeed, exactly one such path determined by always picking the strictly larger child.  Since the structure is perfectly symmetric, *any* leaf can be the one that ends up being popped under the right sequence of strict inequalities.  Moreover, by symmetry, each of the \\\\(2^{n-1}\\\\) leaves contributes the same count of valid heaps.  Hence our final answer will be\\n\\n\\\\[\\n   \\\\bigl(\\\\text{number of deterministic‐along‐a‐fixed‐path heaps}\\\\bigr)\\n   \\\\times 2^{\\\\,n-1}\\\\;\\\\bmod p.\\n\\\\]\\n\\nWe now describe how to count “deterministic‐along‐a‐fixed‐path” heaps of height \\\\(n\\\\) summing to \\\\(k\\\\).  Label our path so that at each level we go “down” into one distinguished child; call that the “continuation” side, and the other child the “off‐path” side.  We only require strict inequality between the two children on that path.  Outside that one path no further inequalities are needed.\\n\\nWe define two DP tables (all modulo \\\\(p\\\\)).\\n\\n1) **Unconstrained**  \\n   \\\\[\\n     \\\\mathrm{all}[h][s]\\\\;=\\\\;\\\\text{(number of ways to distribute $s$ adds among all $2^h-1$ nodes of a perfect subtree of height $h$, with no determinism constraint).}\\n   \\\\]\\n   Since distributing \\\\(s\\\\) identical adds into \\\\(N=2^h -1\\\\) distinct boxes (the \\\\(f\\\\)-values) is\\n   \\\\(\\\\displaystyle \\\\binom{s+N-1}{N-1}\\\\), we can compute\\n   \\\\[\\n     \\\\mathrm{all}[h][s]\\n       = \\\\binom{s + (2^h-1)-1}{\\\\,s\\\\,}\\n       = \\\\binom{s + 2^h -2}{\\\\,s\\\\,},\\n   \\\\]\\n   for \\\\(0\\\\le s\\\\le k\\\\).

Finally the root itself gets the leftover adds\\n   \\\\(\\\\;S-(x+y)\\\\), which is forced once \\\\(x,y\\\\) are chosen.\\n\\n   We compute the inner sum \\n   \\\\(\\\\sum_{y=x+in[\\\\dots]}\\\\mathrm{path}[h-1][y]\\\\)\\n   by maintaining prefix sums of \\\\(\\\\mathrm{path}[h-1]\\\\).

We only need to enforce strict “larger‐child” comparisons along the *single* root‐to‐leaf path that the pop algorithm actually follows.  All other nodes in the tree may have ties freely.\\n\\n2. By symmetry there are \\\\(2^{n-1}\\\\) leaves (hence that many possible final pop‐paths), and each leaf‐path contributes the same count of heaps.  So we just compute “how many heaps follow a *fixed* path deterministically” and multiply by \\\\(2^{\\\\,n-1}\\\\).\\n\\n3. We let  \\n   - \\\\(\\\\mathrm{all}[h][s]\\\\) = the number of ways to distribute \\\\(s\\\\) adds into an unconstrained perfect subtree of height \\\\(h\\\\).  \\n     Since that is “nonnegative solutions of \\\\(f_1+\\\\cdots+f_{2^h-1}=s\\\\),” it’s a stars‐and‐bars binomial \\n     \\\\(\\\\binom{s + (2^h-1)-1}{\\\\,s\\\\,}.\\\\)\\n\\n   - \\\\(\\\\mathrm{path}[h][s]\\\\) = the number of ways if we *do* impose strict “go‐down‐this‐fixed‐child” at each internal node on the one path of length \\\\(h-1\\\\).\\n\\n   We build \\\\(\\\\mathrm{path}[h]\\\\) from \\\\(\\\\mathrm{path}[h-1]\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\mathrm{all}[h-1]\\\\) in \\\\(O(k^2)\\\\) time per height, for \\\\(h=2,\\\\dots,n\\\\).  Since \\\\(\\\\sum n\\\\le500\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\sum k\\\\le500\\\\), the overall time is well under a few \\\\(10^7\\\\) operations.\\n\\n4.
