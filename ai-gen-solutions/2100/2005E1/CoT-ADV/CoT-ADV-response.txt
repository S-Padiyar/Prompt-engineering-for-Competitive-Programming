Problem Restatement  
We have an array a of length l and an n×m matrix b. Two players, Tsovak (who moves first) and Narek, take turns selecting a cell of the matrix that matches the current array element. On turn i, the player must choose a cell (r,c) such that b[r][c] = a[i].  After choosing (r,c), the next player’s choice must come from the submatrix with rows > r and columns > c.  If on your turn you cannot find a matching cell in the allowed submatrix (or the submatrix is empty), you lose.  If the previous move consumed the last element of a, then the player to move next has no more elements to match and thus also loses.  We must determine, under optimal play, whether Tsovak (the first player) wins (“T”) or loses (“N”).

Input  
t — number of test cases (≤ 300).  
For each test case:  
l, n, m (each ≤ 300)  
a[1…l] (each ≤ 7)  
n rows of m integers b[i][j] (each ≤ 7)  
Sum of (n⋅m) over all test cases ≤ 10^5.  Sum of l over all test cases ≤ 300.

Output  
For each test case, output “T” if Tsovak wins, otherwise “N”.

Key Observations and Algorithmic Pattern  
- We can view the game as a directed acyclic game of states: (pos, r, c), where pos is the current array‐index to match, and the allowed submatrix is rows ≥ r and cols ≥ c.  
- Define a boolean DP:   
  dp[pos][r][c] = “true” if the player to move at state (pos, r, c) can force a win.  
- Recurrence:  
  dp[l+1][*][*] = false (no more array elements ⇒ current player loses).  
  For pos from l down to 1:  
    dp[pos][r][c] = OR over all (x,y) with x≥r, y≥c, and b[x][y] = a[pos], of (¬dp[pos+1][x+1][y+1]).  
  If there is no such (x,y), dp[pos][r][c] is false.  
- Bruteforce is too large (l*n*m * occurrences).  But note that for fixed pos, we only need the 2D‐suffix OR of a sparsely marked grid.  In fact we can compute in O(n*m):  
  Let val[x][y] = 1 if b[x][y] = a[pos] and dp[pos+1][x+1][y+1] = false, else 0.  
  Then  
    dp[pos][r][c] = maximum (OR) of val[x][y] over all x≥r, y≥c  
  and that 2D suffix‐OR can be filled by the simple double loop from bottom‐right to top‐left:  
    dp[pos][r][c] = val[r][c] OR dp[pos][r+1][c] OR dp[pos][r][c+1].  

Complexity  
For each of the l layers, we do an O(n*m) sweep.  Summing over all test cases, ∑(n*m)≤10^5 and ∑l≤300, so O(∑l⋅n⋅m)≤3⋅10^7 operations—comfortable in 2 seconds with efficient I/O.

        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));

                }
            }

            // dpNext[r][c] holds dp[pos+1][r][c]; initialize for pos = l+1 as all false.
            boolean[][] dpNext = new boolean[n + 2][m + 2];

            // Work backwards from pos = l down to 1
            for (int pos = l; pos >= 1; pos--) {
                int want = a[pos];
                boolean[][] dpCurr = new boolean[n + 2][m + 2];
                // Build dpCurr[r][c] = suffix-OR over (x,y) >= (r,c) of
                // (b[x][y]==want && !dpNext[x+1][y+1]).
                for (int r = n; r >= 1; r--) {
                    for (int c = m; c >= 1; c--) {
                        // If we can pick (r,c) to match want and leave the opponent
                        // in a losing state, it's a winning move
                        if (b[r][c] == want && !dpNext[r + 1][c + 1]) {
                            dpCurr[r][c] = true;
                        } else {
                            // Otherwise inherit any winning choice in the submatrix
                            dpCurr[r][c] = dpCurr[r + 1][c] || dpCurr[r][c + 1];
                        }
                    }
                }
                // Move dpCurr → dpNext for the next iteration
                dpNext = dpCurr;
            }

            // At the start pos=1 with submatrix (1,1), if dpNext[1][1] is true, Tsovak wins.
            output.append(dpNext[1][1] ? 'T' : 'N').append('\n');
        }
        System.out.print(output);
    }
}
```

Explanation of Core Logic  
1. We only keep two slices of DP: dpNext for `pos+1`, and dpCurr for `pos`.  
2. For each `pos` (from l down to 1), we compute dpCurr[r][c] by checking if picking cell `(r,c)` is a winning move (i.e. `b[r][c]==a[pos]` and the next‐player state `dpNext[r+1][c+1]` is false) or if any choice in the suffix is winning (suffix‐OR).  
3. After processing all positions, dpNext[1][1] tells us whether the first player (Tsovak) can win starting from the full matrix for `a[1]`.

Sample Walk‐Through (Second Example)  
Input:  
2 2 4  
1 2  
1 1 3 2  
4 2 5 1  

- Initialize dpNext all false.  
- pos=2, want=2 → mark val[r][c] where `b[r][c]==2` and dpNext[r+1][c+1]==false, then do suffix‐OR → dpCurr ends up marking all cells from which you can force picking a “2.”  
- Swap dpNext=dpCurr.  
- pos=1, want=1 → similarly compute dpCurr; we find dpCurr[1][1]=true, so Tsovak wins → “T.”  

Complexity  
Time: O(l·n·m) per test case. Over all test cases ∑(n·m)≤10^5, ∑l≤300 ⇒ ~3·10^7 primitive operations.  
Space: O(n·m) for two DP layers plus O(n·m) for the matrix, which stays well under memory limits.
