    "content": "**Analysis**\n\nWe have an integer sequence a₁,…,aₙ of monster‐levels.  Monocarp starts at level L=1 and walks through the monsters in order.  When he meets monster i:\n\n  – if his current L > aᵢ the monster flees (no fight),  \n  – otherwise he fights (and that counts toward his fight count).  \n\nEvery time he has made exactly k fights (for a fixed k), his level L increases by 1.\n\nWe are then given q queries, each query is a pair (i,k), and we must answer “YES” if in the above process (with exactly that k) Monocarp will fight monster i, and “NO” otherwise.  \n\nA direct simulation for each query is too slow (n,q ≤2·10⁵).  We must answer all queries in about O((n+q)·polylog n).\n\n**Key ideas**\n\n1)  **Split by “small” vs. “large” k**.  Let B be a tunable threshold (we choose B=700).  \n   – For k≤B (“small k”), we can afford to do one O(n) simulation per k, building a bit‐vector fought[k][1..n] telling which monsters are fought.  \n     – That costs O(B·n)≈7·10⁷ operations, which is OK in optimized Java.  \n     – We store each fought[k] in a Java BitSet of size n+1 (using about n/8 bytes ≈25 KB per k, so ~25 MB total).\n\n   – For k>B (“large k”), two observations make each query cheap enough to handle on its own:\n\n     a)  **If k≥i**, then by the time he reaches monster i, he could not possibly have leveled up yet (he needs k fights to get to L=2, but only i−1<k monsters have occurred so far), so L=1≤aᵢ always, hence he fights.  So “YES.”\n\n     b)  **If k·aᵢ > i−1**, then the total number of fights before reaching i (which is at most i−1) is <k·aᵢ, so again he’s forced to fight monster i.  So “YES.”\n\n     c)  Otherwise we must decide by actually counting exactly how many fights happen among monsters 1…i−1.  But when k is large, the number of level‐ups (and hence the number of *phases* we need to consider) stays small: at most ⌈(i−1)/k⌉+1 ≤ ⌈(n−1)/(B+1)⌉+1, which for B=700 is under 300.\n\n     We can therefore precompute, for each ℓ=1…Lₘₐₓ (≈300), the sorted list of all positions j with aⱼ≥ℓ.  Then to simulate how many fights occur before i, we do:\n\n       – Start curPos=1, level=1, fights=0  \n       – While curPos<i and level≤Lₘₐₓ:\n            * In the list of positions ≥level, find by binary‐search the first j≥curPos.\n            * Suppose there are R such positions before i.  If R<k, we add R to fights and stop.\n            * Otherwise the kᵗʰ such position is p, so we add k to fights, set curPos=p+1, level++ and repeat.\n\n     At the end we have the exact count of fights before i, compare to k·aᵢ in O(level‐ups·log n)≈300·18.  Even if all q=2·10⁵ queries fall into the “large” category, that is about 2·10⁵·(300·18)≈1.1·10⁹ very simple ops.  In fast Java on a generous 4 s limit this passes when carefully coded.\n\nOverall complexity:  \n  – Precompute small‐k fights: O(B·n).  \n  – Build the “positions by level” big array in O(Lₘₐₓ·n).  \n  – Each large‐k query in O((n/k)·log n) ≤O(Lₘₐₓ·log n).  \n\nThis runs in ~1 billion primitive steps under 4 s in Java if well‐optimized (no oversized data structures), which fits under 512 MB total.\n\n**Java Implementation**\n\n```java\nimport java.io.*;\nimport java.util.*;\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\n        new Main().run();\n    }\n\n    final int B = 700;            // threshold between “small” and “large” k\n    int n, q;\n    int[] a;\n    int[] Qi, Qk;\n    String[] ans;\n    ArrayList<Integer>[] smallQ;   // smallQ[k] = list of query‐indices with that k (k<=B)\n    ArrayList<Integer> largeQ = new ArrayList<>();\n\n    void run() throws IOException {\n        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));\n        StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\n        n = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\n        q = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\n        a = new int[n+1];\n        st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\n        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n            a[i] = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\n        }\n\n        Qi = new int[q];\n        Qk = new int[q];\n        ans = new String[q];\n\n        // bucket queries by k\n        smallQ = new ArrayList[B+1];\n        for (int k = 1; k <= B; k++) {\n            smallQ[k] = new ArrayList<>();\n        }\n        for (int i = 0; i < q; i++) {\n            st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\n            int idx = i;\n            int ii = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\n            int kk = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());\n            Qi[idx] = ii;\n            Qk[idx] = kk;\n            if (kk <= B) smallQ[kk].add(idx);\n            else largeQ.add(idx);\n        }\n\n        // 1) Handle small k by direct O(n) simulation for each k <= B.\n        //    Store into a BitSet fought[k], then answer queries in smallQ[k].\n        BitSet[] fought = new BitSet[B+1];\n        for (int k = 1; k <= B; k++) {\n            BitSet bs = new BitSet(n+1);\n            fought[k] = bs;\n            int level = 1;\n            int fights = 0;\n            for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n                if (level <= a[i]) {\n                    bs.set(i);\n                    fights++;\n                    if (fights % k == 0) {\n                        level++;\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n            // answer queries with this k\n            for (int idx : smallQ[k]) {\n                int pos = Qi[idx];\n                ans[idx] = (bs.get(pos) ?

We keep two buckets:\n   – `smallQ[k]` for queries with `k≤B`.  \n   – `largeQ` list for queries with `k>B`.\n\n2. **Small‐k preprocessing (k≤B)**  \n   For each `k=1…B` we do one pass over the n monsters:\n   – Maintain `level` (starts 1) and `fights = 0`.  \n   – At monster i, if `level≤a[i]` we mark a fight in a `BitSet` and increment `fights`.  \n   – Whenever `fights%k==0` we increment `level`.  \n   This costs O(n) per k, overall O(B·n).  We then answer all the bucketed queries in O(1) each by checking `BitSet.get(i)`.\n\n3. **Large‐k queries (k>B)**  \n   We first note two easy “YES” cases:\n   - If `k≥i`, no chance to level up before i, so L=1 and we fight.  \n   - If `k·a[i]>i−1`, even if we fought every monster 1…i−1 (max i−1 fights), that's still <k·a[i], so must also fight i.\n\n   Otherwise we do a small “phase‐by‐phase” replay.  Because k is large, the number of times Monocarp can level up (and thus the number of “levels” to test) is only about ⌈(i−1)/k⌉+1 ≤ ⌈(n−1)/(B+1)⌉+1 (~300 for B=700).  \n\n   We precompute for each possible level ℓ=1…Lₘₐₓ the sorted list of *all* positions j with `a[j]≥ℓ` (in one big packed array `big[]` with offsets `off[ℓ]`).  Then each step asks “in that list, how many are ≥currentIndex cur and <i?”, i.e. a lower‐bound plus counting.  This lets us jump in blocks of k fights (level‐up) or finish if fewer than k remain.  \n\n   Each such query takes O(#level‐ups·log n) ≈300·18.  Even for 2·10⁵ queries that is on the order of 1e9 basic operations, which still runs in about 3–4 s in optimized Java on modern judges.\n\nAll together the solution is O(B⋅n + n⋅Lₘₐₓ + q⋅Lₘₐₓ⋅log n), runs within time, and uses under 512 MB of memory."
