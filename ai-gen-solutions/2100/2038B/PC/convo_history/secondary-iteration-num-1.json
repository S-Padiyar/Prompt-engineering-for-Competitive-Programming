    "content": "**Analysis**\n\nWe have an array a of length n.  One allowed operation is:\n\n  • pick an index i  \n  • do  \n     a[i] -= 2  \n     a[i+1] += 1  \n    (with indices taken cyclically, i.e. if i=n then i+1 becomes 1)\n\nWe want—in the end—to have all entries equal to some non‐negative integer k.  Each such operation decreases the total sum of the array by 1, so if initially\n\n S = ∑ᵢ a[i],  \n\nand we perform m operations, the final sum is S – m.  Since the n entries are all equal to k, we must have\n\n  S – m = n·k,  \n\nhence\n\n  m = S – n·k.  \n\nWe wish to make all entries equal, and we want to minimize m.  Since m≥0, we must choose an integer k≤⌊S/n⌋, and\n\n  m = S – n·k.  \n\nClearly to minimize m we would try to push k as large as possible—i.e. k=⌊S/n⌋—and then check if it is actually possible to level out the array to that value k.  If it is possible, m=S–n·⌊S/n⌋ is the answer; otherwise no smaller k can do better in terms of fewer operations, and we report –1.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\n1.  Compute  \n     S = ∑₁ⁿ a[i],  \n    let  \n     k = S / n     (integer division),  \n     neededOps = S – n·k.  \n\n2.  Form  \n     c[i] = a[i] – k,  \n    so that ∑c[i]=neededOps≥0.\n\n3.  We must check whether, by a sequence of the allowed “–2 here, +1 next” moves, we can drive all c[i] to 0 simultaneously.  \n\n   A well-known trick is to note that the total ∑c[i]≥0 guarantees that there *is* some cyclic starting position from which a “prefix‐sum-never-drops-below-0” argument holds (a classical “gas‐station” argument).  Concretely:\n\n   • We scan c[0..n–1] once, maintaining a running sum cur.  \n   • Whenever cur+drops<0, we reset cur=0 and declare the next index our new “start.”  \n   • By the end, we have found a start index s (0≤s<n) such that, if you cyclically lay out the c[i] beginning at s, all partial sums are ≥0.\n\n4.  Once we have a valid start s, we *simulate* a single pass of the array from i=s, s+1, …, s+n–1 (mod n).  We carry a variable prev, initially 0, which represents how many “+1’s” have been carried in from the previous slot’s operations.  At each slot i:\n\n     cp = c[i] + prev\n     if cp<0 then fail immediately (we couldn’t fill a deficit here)\n     let ops = cp/2  (each operation here removes 2 from cp and generates 1 to carry)\n     totalOps += ops\n     prev = ops\n\n   After we do exactly n positions, every c[i] + whatever carry arrives must have been nonnegative, so we never had a negative deficit, and we only ever did integral operations.  \n\n5.  At the end of that single sweep, two things must hold:\n\n   (a) we never “fail” with cp<0  \n   (b) the total number of operations we actually *used* ≔ totalOps must equal neededOps  \n\n   if so, the answer is totalOps; otherwise it is impossible (–1).\n\nThis runs in O(n) per test.  Summed over all test cases, the total n≤2⋅10⁵, so it is perfectly fast.\n\nBelow is a Java implementation.\n\n```java\nimport java.io.BufferedReader;\nimport java.io.InputStreamReader;\nimport java.io.IOException;\nimport java.util.StringTokenizer;\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\n        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));\n        StringTokenizer st;\n        \n        int t = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine().trim());\n        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\n        \n        while (t-- > 0) {\n            int n = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine().trim());\n            long[] a = new long[n];\n            st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\n            long sum = 0;\n            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                a[i] = Long.parseLong(st.nextToken());\n                sum += a[i];\n            }\n            \n            // k = floor(sum / n), number of operations needed = sum - n*k\n            long k = sum / n;\n            long needed = sum - k * n;  // this is >= 0\n            \n            // Build c[i] = a[i] - k\n            long[] c = new long[n];\n            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                c[i] = a[i] - k;\n            }\n            \n            // Find a start index s using the \"gas station\" trick\n            long curr = 0;\n            int start = 0;\n            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                curr += c[i];\n                if (curr < 0) {\n                    curr = 0;\n                    start = i + 1;\n                }\n            }\n            if (start >= n) start = 0;  // wrap if needed\n            \n            // One pass simulation\n            long prev = 0;\n            long usedOps = 0;\n            boolean ok = true;\n            for (int tpos = 0; tpos < n; tpos++) {\n                int idx = (start + tpos) % n;\n                long cp = c[idx] + prev;\n                if (cp < 0) {\n                    ok = false;\n                    break;\n                }\n                long ops = cp / 2;      // how many \"–2 here, +1 next\" we do\n                usedOps += ops;\n                prev = ops;             // that many +1's carry to the next slot\n            }\n            \n            if (!ok || usedOps != needed) {\n                sb.append(\"-1\\n\");\n            } else {\n                sb.append(usedOps).append('\\n');\n            }\n        }\n        \n        System.out.print(sb);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation of Key Steps**\n\n1.  **Choosing k**  \n    Since each operation reduces the total sum by 1, if we do exactly m operations, the final sum is S–m, which must equal n·k when all n entries are the same integer k.  Thus\n\n       m = S – n·k  ≥ 0  \n\n    and to make m as small as possible we take the largest integer k≤S/n, i.e. k=⌊S/n⌋.\n\n2.  **Reduction to an array c**  \n    Write c[i]=a[i]–k.  Then ∑c[i]=S–n·k=m≥0.  We want by our “–2 here, +1 next” moves to drive all c[i] to 0.  Observe that an operation at i exactly takes 2 from c[i] and adds 1 to c[i+1].\n\n3.  **Finding a non‐negative prefix rotation**  \n    A classical lemma (“gas station” or “circular sequence of gains/losses”) says: if the total sum of c is non‐negative then there is some cyclic shift of the c array so that *every* prefix is non‐negative.  Equivalently, there is a start index s so that\n     \n       c[s] + c[s+1] + … + c[s+t]  ≥ 0  for  t=0,1,…,n–1.\n\n    We find that s in O(n) by scanning once and resetting whenever the partial sum would go negative.\n\n4.  **One‐pass “greedy” simulation**  \n    Starting at index s, we carry an integer prev = how many “+1’s” from the previous slot’s operations.  At slot i we see \n\n       c[i] + prev = current surplus\n\n    if that is negative we cannot fill a deficit ⇒ fail.  \n    Otherwise we can perform ops = (c[i]+prev)/2 operations at i, each removes 2 from the local surplus and creates 1 to carry on.  We accumulate those ops in usedOps, and set prev = ops to carry to the next index.  \n\n    After exactly n steps, if we have neither failed nor used more/ fewer than the required m=S–n·k operations, we have shown we can indeed level the array to k in exactly usedOps=m steps.  If anything goes wrong, the answer is –1.\n\nThis runs in O(n) per test, which is fast enough for n total up to 2·10⁵."
